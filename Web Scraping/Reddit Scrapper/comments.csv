When you obtain a bitcoin (through work, gifting, exchanging it for fiat currency, etc.) it now becomes subject to these market fluctuations no matter where it is stored. 

Look at it similarly to owning a bar of gold. If you purchase a bar of gold, it's value in exchange for dollars will always change, even if you have it stored away in a safe vault. The same applies to bitcoin.",2020-08-02 02:47:14,Bitcoin,i19uta,AstarJoe

25,"Welcome new Bitcoiners!! 

Recently, Bitcoin enthusiasts have been less focused on trading volatility and more intent on accumulating more Bitcoin over time-- or ""stacking sats."" 

I wrote this [article](https://ryze.substack.com/p/a-guide-to-stacking-sats) outlining 3 easy ways to stack sats and accumulate more Bitcoin over time. 

1. **Dollar-cost averaging**: buying $X amount of Bitcoin on a fixed time interval 
2. **Buying the dip**: purchasing Bitcoin when the price drops by a certain amount  
3. **Earning Bitcoin**: getting Bitcoin-back on purchases instead of cash-back or points

The article goes over how these three strategies can work, as well as some products that you can use to achieve them.

95,"New to bitcoin, but have been researching for my paper for a while. One thing I never understood was how mining with your own CPU gets you bitcoin. If you get money by solving computational problems to confirm transactions, how does that get you bitcoin. You get traditional money by doing a useful task for someone, but how does confirming transactions become useful for anybody?",2020-09-24 05:49:09,Bitcoin,i19uta,brbinsky
96,"&gt; You get traditional money by doing a useful task for someone, but how does confirming transactions become useful for anybody?

As a miner, you are providing settlement security for bitcoin transactions by mining, that's why people are valuing it high enough and paying money for that activity.  

The useful task here is security.   

&gt; One thing I never understood was how mining with your own CPU gets you bitcoin.  

You provide computer power according to the rules of the network, and get newly issued bitcoin + transaction fees as a reward (in relation to how much computer power you offer). Not sure if this explains it satisfactory to you, but this is the gist of it. And CPU mining is not a thing anymore, bitcoin mining requires specialized hardware (called ASICs) nowadays.",2020-10-06 17:52:15,Bitcoin,i19uta,TheGreatMuffin
97,i have a question. i cannot find any resources that explain it. can i send from a segwit address to a legacy address?,2020-09-28 09:27:17,Bitcoin,i19uta,Atomica1
98,"&gt; can i send from a segwit address to a legacy address?

On the protocol level, any address is compatible with any other address, regardless of its format.  

Some badly programmed maintained wallets have issues with recognizing newer address formats, but I haven't heard from any wallet having problems with sending **from** a newer address format to a legacy format. Would be surprising if this were the case with any wallet, so you shouldn't have any problems with that.  

To avoid such type of issues I would recommend to always use a ""proper"" wallet (recommendations you can find here: https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/recommended-wallets.html)",2020-10-06 17:55:47,Bitcoin,i19uta,TheGreatMuffin

100,"&gt; i would love for someone who is well known and respected from inside the OG btc circle to just step out and tell us.. segwit is good! trust it!

I doubt any of ""OG btc circle"" would do that because it's not really what those type of people are in bitcoin for (if I may stereotype them). Bitcoin is about trust minimization, and stepping up and proclaim ""trust me"" is the opposite of that, and implies authority, trust and simply would look scammy, tbh.  

Also, no human made software is guaranteed to be free from bugs, so if someone would claim something like above, they would imply they know that there are no bugs, no issues etc, which is simply not something anyone can claim (or would want to), because there are no 100% certainties.

142,"What a full bitcoin node does is verify transactions, because it has every single block and transaction in bitcoin history, and enforce the rules of bitcoin‚Äôs protocol. After you‚Äôre synced, you can literally look up any block or any transaction, similar to how you do on a site like blockchain.com/explorer (except now its on your hard drive instead of on their server)

When a new transaction (Alice wants to sends John 2 BTC) is broadcasted, full nodes will check if the transaction is legit (e.g those are actually Alice‚Äôs coins, no coins created from nothing, etc). If there is any issue, the node reject the transaction and no other nodes will hear about it.

Imagine if there is a node from a coder who thought ‚Äúman i think miners should be able to fit more transactions into a block!‚Äù The coder could edit the bitcoin code and try to convince miners to use his software, and try to broadcast a block with more transactions than currently allowed. Other legit bitcoin nodes would just reject their block.

In the end, it‚Äôs mostly an enthusiast thing in my opinion for bitcoin ! I would say its not necessary for most people. The idea is that with a full node, you dont have to trust, you can verify, but my view is that most people who dont code will just be blindly following the instructions on how to install and not understand anyway haha!

As for safety, you couldn't care less about whatever exploit they solved with the new whatever release if your machine is air gaped.

515,"Hi and welcome.  

Will try to answer briefly, although your questions have a lot of variables and subtleties, so keep that in mind please.  

&gt; However, if every merchant simply accepted Bitcoin, people can simply pay with their phones, without the need for cash. Everybody, and their grandmother, has a smartphone or two. Am I missing something here, or am I correct with the ease of use?  

You are correct, it's *relatively* easy to use. However, there is this thing about bitcoin that every transaction competes with every other transaction on the network for confirmations. This competition is resolved by fees attached to every transaction. In times where is not many tx's, it doesn't matter. But when a lot of tx's come into the network, the ones with the higher fees get priority over lower fee ones.  

This means that when there are a lot of tx's going on, either you have to wait longer times for confirmations, or you pay a higher fee. Usually the former is not a problem, your transaction will either get confirmed or doesn't leave your wallet. But people who are not familiar with how it works oftentimes freak out and think their transaction is ""stuck"".  

This might be a problem in real-life situations for people who are not familiar with bitcoin's quirks. That said, transactions are instantly visible in your recipient's wallet, it's just that the confirmations take time.    

Another possibility would be to use Lightning network which allows instant and almost fee-less payments (for a fraction of a cent), but it doesn't have a frictionless user experience either yet.  

&gt; The second problem we have is that nobody in Libya can be transferred money, from outside of Libya, even if Libyans had international friends and family willing to help them with money. But, with Bitcoin, you can simply transfer funds online with relative ease. Am I correct here, as well?  

I would say this is absolutely correct. Sending bitcoin over borders is as frictionless as sending a SMS to someone (and it cannot be stopped or censored like SMS can).  

&gt;  I have no idea whether or not Bitcoin is currently available in Libya; furthermore, I have no idea whether or not Bitcoin is legal in Libya (and, frankly, if the aforementioned problems can be solved, nobody will care about its ""legality""). So, can Bitcoin be adopted in Libya, with relative ease, without necessitating the banking system or government? Or would this undertaking be a major project?  

You don't need the banking system for bitcoin at all, so I would say it's easy in this regard.  

However, the vast majority of people will still need your local currency to pay for rent, food etc, and will probably need some ways to convert bitcoin into said local currency. So banks/governments could potentially make your life a little harder by refusing service (or imposing penalties, fines, bans etc) when they suspect the money has something to do with bitcoin.  

Summarized, I would say you generally are correct that bitcoin makes some of your usecases a little (or a lot) easier, but keep in mind that in practice there are a lot of quirks that need to be figured out or at least understood, so bitcoin is not a panacea either.  

Please also keep in mind that I am not an expert by any means, so it's all very subjective. I hope it's helpful in any way. Please feel free to ask more.",2020-10-13 06:09:05,Bitcoin,ja2hwt,TheGreatMuffin
516,"Thank you for the thorough response. Very helpful and appreciated. You do raise a few points that I'd like to address:  
(1) So, my understanding is that transactions may be slow in some circumstances. Frankly, I think one hour line-ups outside of grocery stores, with food in hand, waiting for transactions to go through, would be a non-issue, in comparison to days-long line-ups outside of banks with depleted reserves, just to end up going home empty handed. So, fortunately, I think this shouldn't be too much of a show-stopper, for now at least.

(2) However, the main point you bring up here is the ability, or rather inability, to convert Bitcoin to Libyan currency (i.e., dinars) for payments that require cash. Payments requiring cash, such as rent or utilities, may likely not change. However, I think a Bitcoin proposal would be meaningful to retailers like restaurants, moms and pops convenience stores, major grocery stores, gas stations, etc. Those were mainly what my idea was targeting. That said, you actually brought to my attention another issue, aside from the potential difficultly of converting Bitcoin to dinars. How does one even go about converting dinars to Bitcoin? I suspect a major retailer, like a grocery store, can be a Bitcoin dealer? Is that accurate? If so, how would this retailer have access to Bitcoin? And what would they do with the cash that they're being given in exchange for Bitcoin? How does the retailer digitally access Bitcoin's network and upload physical cash, without a digital wallet, since the only way Libya works is through cash?",2020-10-13 09:49:35,Bitcoin,ja2hwt,OkCheerio
517,"I‚Äôm not sure what the costs of living are in your country, but the fastest wat to get some bitcoin would be via donations, or from friends/relatives that live abroad. 
When there‚Äôs some bitcoin in your local network it can be enough for day to day trades. For example the store manager recieves bitcoin for groceries. He can Exchange these coins for Dinar with someone that wants to buy bitcoin. This way the bitcoin can reduce the need for cash in your community.

You should ignore that point. At this point, almost no body uses on-chain transactions. People use lightning wallets such as bluewallet, breez, wallet of satoshi, which do not cost much when doing lightning transactions. The process of owning bitcoin is much simpler with many of these wallets, if not with all ( custodial is simpler for user).

Buy Bitcoin with Cash by Mail (not recommended). I guess you will need to transfer Dinars to US dollars or Euros first somehow. Could that be done on for example marketplaces in Lybia?
Paxful also offers services for finding sellers who accept cash through the mail. You may also find suitable sellers on darknet markets. As with in-person purchases, try to only trade with established users who have a good reputation. Choosing a reliable seller is your best protection against fraud, and escrow should always be employed. This method involves some obvious downsides, such as slowness and the risk that your envelope may get lost or stolen en route. I recommend wrapping the bills in a couple of layers of paper, so that they can‚Äôt be easily detected without opening the envelope. In the event that your envelope never arrives, or arrives empty, certain sellers may compensate you. To qualify, you may be requested to film or photograph yourself placing the money within the envelope, sealing it, and mailing it. For greater safety, I advise using registered mail, then having the seller sign after they receive it. This method creates a degree of proof that you paid via escrow, although the amount of cash within the envelope may still be disputed.

\- **Health benefits**: taken regularly it increased life expectancy and fortified over all health levels (in many cases life expectancy was tripled);

\- **Addictiveness**: the spice had narcotic properties, thus increasing demand and creating a large and hungry market for it. An individual's addiction to the spice would worsen the more they consumed it.

\- **Physical effects**: sustained use of the spice led to human eyes being discolored so that the entire eye would be stained blue - so called Eyes of Ibad.

The adoption speed as well as the suitability of this finite real estate that has no physical borders and therefore is suitable land for all human beings on planet earth. This coupled with the extreme divisibility means there is no real barrier to entry, ie, high upfront cost

This can only really be compared to if the internet itself had the ability to buy a piece of it back in 1998.

Part of its beauty and paradigm shifts Bitcoin presents  is that the actionable opportunity is more readily available to be taken by the little guy first. Then corporations. Then large corporations. Then publicly traded corporations. Then governments.

Whereas fiat begins top down, bitcoins decentralized nature upends the script and presents the common man with the most unique opportunity they will see in their life. 

I was going to say that it's true that perhaps for a VC firm getting pitched Facebook PreIPO or Uber or whatever might have been a better opportunity.

There will never again be this kind of opportunity. 

Its like betting on the big short in the housing crisis where its just ridiculously obvious what happens next and how it triggers the next falling domino and onwards.

So after 1 year, the price would be 10,000x1.26=12,600. The next year, 12,600x1.26=15,876. Then 15,876x1.26=20,003. Keep going for 10 years, and you're at 100,800. 

Another way to look at it, if it did increase by 10k each year, then the first year would be a 100% return. The next year would only be a 50% return (10k increase off of a base of 20k, means a 50% return). Then the next year it would only be a 33% return.

That would be okay (not great, but okay) for rolling back any fraudulent transactions (along with many legit transactions unfortunately), but there's still no way forward for Bitcoin. Tell me, how would you be able to demonstrate that you know the private key that controls a given coin without divulging the public key for that coin? And the instant you divulge the public key, a million other people could solve for the private key and produce signatures valid under that public key as well.

667,"I doubt this is worth worrying about. If ECDSA is broken, it isn't going to go from ""impossible to find a private key"" to ""can find any private key within an hour"" overnight. Initially it will probably take long times to calculate any private key (weeks/months/years), and thus allow plenty of time to migrate to a new signature scheme, through a soft-fork which introduces it and allows the old scheme to continue working alongside it. Realistically, people will be given adequate notice that they need to move their ECDSA secured bitcoin to whatever Post-Quantum-secured mechanism is chosen.

People really need to abandon the silly idea that Bitcoin can or will be hard forked. It's just unrealistic and would completely destroy it's most significant feature - of being a money that nobody can interfere with.",2020-10-13 08:16:55,Bitcoin,j9srvv,WittyStick

I think a bigger cause for concern is the upcoming adoption of Schnorr signatures. While there are feasible post-quantum replacements for ECDSA, there are no known non-interactive post quantum signature aggregation schemes, to my knowledge, which would be able to replace all of the protocols that people are going to start building upon Schnorr signatures and depending on.

Bitcoin has the ability to be anonymous, but when you attach your SSN to it, it is obviously no longer anonymous.  All depends on whether or not you taint it with personal data.

Yes... its called analytics.

It's not obvious.  You have to search it out and pay for the privilege.  Here's a good starting spot: https://kycnot.me/

I prefer a different vendor, but HW wallets are generally always a good investment.  You can get some for $10 or some for $1000.  They are all good, but I wouldn't default to the most expensive one and assume its the best.

&gt; Why is bitcoin tied to country currency? What will happen to bitcoin value if the country currency is worthless?

791,"&gt; I see this sometimes, where people mention to send all BTC holdings into 1 address during period of low network fees. But how does this practically work?  

Imagine that the bitcoin in your wallet are actual metal coins, like those in your ""real"" wallet. Now imagine that in one pocket you have $1 coin, and in other pocket you have 100 pennies. Both have the exact same value, but when you want to pay $1 to somebody, the 100 pennies will weight more and take more space than a $1 coin.  

This is exactly the same how bitcoin transactions (UTXOs) work. If you received 1 bitcoin through multiple transactions, and then send this bitcoin to somebody else, it will be more expensive compared to if you received 1 bitcoin in one transaction, and then send it forward to somebody else.  

So in periods where there are not many transactions on the network (= fees are low), some people take their 100 pennies and ""melt"" them down into $1 coin, so to speak. So in the future their transactions will potentially be cheaper.  

&gt; Would it require setting up a brand new wallet each time?  

No, any wallet can give you an infinite number of new addresses, so for consolidation you just need to take a previously unused address from your wallet and send all the funds to that new address. The transaction will be sent and needs to be confirmed, but the coins will basically never leave your wallet (because your private key controls all the addresses associated with your wallet).  

But beware, consolidation can have negative consequences for your privacy. F.ex if you have some coins that you acquired anonymously, and some coins that you acquired through an exchange which has your ID etc, by mixing those coins you give up the privacy of those anonymous coins.",2020-10-13 03:58:51,Bitcoin,ja00hu,TheGreatMuffin

817,"&gt; into 1 address

Correction, into 1 coin  
Every time you receive Bitcoin from someone, your wallet grows 1 coin bigger. When you want to spend Bitcoin, you pay a transaction fee proportional to the number of bytes your transaction occupies in a Bitcoin block. If your transaction spends many coins, it will have a higher fee than if it spends one coin  

To avoid high fees, some people recommend sending a transaction to yourself, spending all your coins and creating one new coin. Do this when fees are low. Then the next spending transaction will only be spending one coin instead of many coins, so it will use only a few bytes of space and its fee will be low

&gt; Would it require setting up a brand new wallet

An address is a single-use token. A wallet typically has hundreds of addresses (maybe thousands). A consolidation transaction retires several addresses and creates a new coin with a new address.

For example, lets say the BTC market price is $10,000. The selling company will say that they charge 8%. If there is no Tom Foolery, then a consumer will pay the BTM ~$10,800 for 1 BTC and be on their Libratarian way. But... If there IS Tom Foolery, the BTM company will still boast of charging 8% yet they will sell you the bitcoin for $12,000. That means a consumer using the BTM will need to pay ~$12,960 for 1 bitcoin that is currently worth $10,000.

You can also earn interest in kind on BTC, ETH, etc. The interest is supposed to vary week to week depending on how their business is going (their stated goal is to pay out 80% of their profits in interest, versus the inverse (or worse) that you see with traditional banks), but it's been pretty consistent in the months I've been with them. 

This week's rate for BTC (up to 5 BTC) is 6.2% (for any BTC beyond 5 I believe the rate drops to around 4% for the excess ones), and it's compounded weekly. You get a push notification each week reminding you that you just got interest. I keep about 10% of my BTC there.

If you mean to say the CME contracts lead the market, it's pretty easy to demonstrate this is not really the case.  I don't honestly feel like putting the work in to do so right now, but others have.  All you need to do is aggregate a bunch of spot and derivative contracts and look at very small time frames to see which market is leading.  CME never really has.  Sure, you could claim traders take positions on CME and then move the market on spot exchanges to realize CME gains, but that would be very tough to prove.

1150,"Maybe.  But it really depends on exactly what you mean.

Bitcoin is traded many places.  CME is one of those places.  I thing you're asking, generally, how influential the CME contracts are on the price of Bitcoin.  Does that sound vaguely right?

If that's the case, I think it's reasonable to ask if CME seems to be setting the pace, or some other exchange or exchanges are instead.  Recently, the best evidence I've seen (don't take this as gospel) is that spot markets seem to be leading (think, Coinbase, Finex, Binance, OKex, etc) and futures markets following.  No real way to know how OTC markets fit in (those are the 3 main types of markets: spot, futures/derivatives, OTC).

Now, are there times when futures markets lead?  Yes, they usually do.  Does CME lead the pack in that group?  I don't think so.  The open interest is usually lagging other contracts (meaning it's a smaller player), but it is the only main cash settled one, I think.  So it does have something of a special position.

Anyway, here's the tldr version if you ask me about CME in general.  Lots of people try to make CME futures into something bigger than it is, especially gaps and the like.  They usually don't provide any real evidence why we ought to care.  Lack of evidence means I ignore this talk as idle chatter.  But find me something specific and then I'll look into it, within reason.",2020-10-13 14:08:08,Bitcoin,ja8mh5,Brettanomyces78

1152,"When you buy BTC from an exchange, it will be available to you in an ""account"" controlled by the exchange. That ""account"" is actually a type of Bitcoin wallet called a ""custodial"" wallet: For the duration of your coins existing on that exchange, the cryptographic keys used to secure those coins are controlled by the exchange, and not you.

You should therefore consider transferring those coins from the exchange's wallet to one controlled by you. Assuming you have one setup on your smartphone like BlueWallet, GreenWallet or whatever, it will provide you with a wallet address for sending funds to.

To send the coins from the exchange to your wallet, just type the address generated by your wallet into the field labeled ""send"" (or whatever your exchange labels it as) on the exchange itself, and wait up to an hour for the funds to appear on your wallet.

Take care when typing addresses! One mis-typed character and you'll receive nothing and the coins will be lost.

If you want to learn more, and start your journey down the rabbit hole, I (and many others) have benefited hugely from videos and presentations done by Andreas Antonopoulos. He's on Twitter and YouTube.

Once you've learned more, and you want to figure out which wallet best suits you (smartphone, hardware or desktop) then you're in luck, I built this for you :-)

Many people with wallets lose their bitcoin through phishing attacks and installing scam wallets while these losses never occur on Coinbase. And it is a childish fantasy to imagine that insiders at Coinbase will conspire to steal crypto assets from Coinbase. The only risk of a custodial account is from Coinbase's relationship with the legal system. The likelihood of freezing all bitcoin accounts is about the same as freezing all bank accounts.

1162,"It's WAY more complex, but just to simply. Every exchange has a specific wallet for your account. Every Bitcoin you buy or deposit on their site will end up in there.

Remember that ""not your keys, not your coins"", so those Bitcoins won't be actually yours until you move them to your own wallet. Every wallet has a unique public address (or public key), just like a bank account. You just need to share that address with anyone who is going to send you some BTC, like the exchange. After you click the ""withdraw"" button on the exchange it will ask you for your public address. They'll probably take a fee and send your money.

On the other side, you'll find another key in every wallet, the private key. This one is the one you should never share with anyone because it will help you  ""prove"" that you are the owner of that wallet, so you can spend the money in there. I started using a mobile wallet, Coinomi. It's pretty easy and works fine.

As I mentioned before, it's way more complex and there so many things I didn't mention that are really important, such as seed phrases and hardware wallets (which are way more secure, check them out).

1165,"Address is like your bank account number . You can get as many account numbers as you want (they are all free). To withdraw you need the password for that account number. Your wallet keeps track of all the passwords of all your addresses through a master password , called the ‚Äúseed‚Äù consisting of 12 or 24 words.

Cold storage is about where you store the passwords . If you store on your phone it is more dangerous as someone could hack your phone, on exchange is considered even more dangerous , as the exchange could go bankrupt or turn out to be run by scammers . 

Cold storage means that the passwords are stored on a device that you own , which is not connected to the internet. (This device could be a piece of paper with the passwords written on it , a computer , or a hardware wallet , or your brain, in which case people talk about a brain-wallet).

It is advised to always hit that receive button, generating a new unique public BTC address for all newly received Bitcoin. I mean, you can use the same public one over and over again because it‚Äôs associated only with your private seed, but security purposes says don‚Äôt. Also, every time you plug your Trezor into your PC a prompt comes up for inputting the pin you initially made.

&gt;The ongoing hype about the abnormally high returns from Defi tokens has naturally seen many more investors moving funds to decentralized protocols. As of October 10, total value locked in Defi protocols was nearly $11 billion. However, despite this apparent endorsement of Defi, rug pulling incidents and outright scams now seem to be blighting this space.

&gt;News.bitcoin.com has been reporting on the growing popularity of Defi protocols as well as exposing the fact that some devs and founders wilfully engage in practices that harm interests of the burgeoning Defi community.
SBF‚Äôs Actions Were Not Approved by the Community

&gt;Just recently, Sam Bankman Fried (SBF), the individual that took over the reins at SushiSwap in early September, was accused of acting immorally. The allegations stem from SBF‚Äôs use of FTT (a centralized token) as collateral for short selling other assets. It has emerged that SBF‚Äôs actions were not approved by the community and reports suggest the matter will be resolved via a vote which ends October 14.

&gt;However, before the vote is even closed, critics are making the argument that if ‚Äúeconomically rational market participants such as SBF are able to take advantage these tools in a way that the community doesn‚Äôt approve of, the immaturity of both the market and its users are revealed.‚Äù

&gt;Meanwhile, SBF, who is defending his actions, is not the only influencer getting panned for using a privileged position to enrich himself. Blue Kirby, the YFI fanboy, is another prominent individual that has been criticized first for actively promoting Andre Cronje‚Äôs botched EMN before it got hacked. Secondly, Kirby faces accusations of dumping his YFI when the Defi token suffered losses in the past few weeks.
12 Defi Con Artists Exposed

&gt;The complaints against SBF and Blue Kirby are just two of the many cases where influential individuals are caught acting contrary to the values they publicly espouse. In many cases, however, Defi con artists are only exposed after making off with millions of dollars in investor funds. Below News.bitcoin.com lists some Defi projects or tokens, which according to a Boxmining newsletter, have turned out to be scams.

&gt;Amplyfi.money: Rug pulled after collecting 2,500 ETH from investors. According to a message left on the website, the Amplyfi.money team claim that ‚Äúone of the devs compromised wallet and was able to use a little-known vulnerability in the compiler itself.‚Äù It adds that ‚Äúdevs are receiving a fair amount of threats so we decided to terminate the project.‚Äù

&gt;Beer Garden Finance: According to the newsletter, the founder holds over 50% of the token supply in his personal wallet. When the community asked for more details such as a Github link for the project, or timelocks for the tokens they were banned from the Telegram group.

&gt;Burn Vault Finance ($BFV): The newsletter says the team behind this protocol rug pulled. News.bitcoin.com also confirmed the community Telegram account is no longer active.

&gt;CBDAO ($BREE): According to the Newsletter, the project had a presale for $SBREE tokens which would be swapped for $BREE. One of the admin wallets exploited a backdoor in the SBREE token contract, minted 50,000 SBREE. After that, the SBREE was converted into BREE and sold it on the market thus pushing down the price of BREE at the expense of other holders. The 50,000 BREE was sold for under 200 ETH.

&gt;Degenballz: The Boxmining newsletter says staking ‚Äúmay steal 1% of your LP tokens.‚Äù On Twitter, one user is seemingly complaining about the 1% LP staking fee paid to developers. The user known as HuntingtheCoins expresses disappointment that this fact had not been disclosed upfront.

&gt;Emerald Mine (EMD): According to the newsletter, user tokens worth nearly USD$2.5mil that were supposedly locked under a smart contract were moved to another account. Fortunately, cryptocurrency exchange Changenow managed to stop the sale of 135,020 EOS. However, this only represents a tiny portion of the total amount of funds stolen.

&gt;Lv.finance: Falsified audit results, after investors deposited their funds in they found they were unable to withdraw. The team has since disappeared and the website was down at the time of writing.

&gt;Minions Farm: Minions will access all your assets when you connect your wallet to the Minions Wallet site. According to the message left Minions Farm‚Äôs page on Medium, the post(s) was under investigation for alleged violation of posting rules. The official website was also down at the time of writing.

&gt;Tomatoes.finance: The newsletter says a hacker allegedly triggered simple permission granting and withdrew tokens. News.bitcoin.com observed that since September 23, there has been no activity on their Medium page.

&gt;UniCat ($MEOW): A back door in smart contracts allowed UniCat to keep control over users‚Äô tokens even after they were withdrawn from the pool. Around USD$200,000 worth of crypto has supposedly been stolen.

&gt;Unirocket ($URCKT): The newsletter says creators of this token rug-pulled and now cannot be located on social media. Similarly, News.bitcoin.com could not find any information on Unirocket on social media.

&gt;Yfdex.finance: Project promoted themselves on Twitter for 2 days, took a total of USD$20million of investor funds and disappeared. News.bitcoin.com reported on Yfdex.finance scam in September.

&gt;From the list, prospective Defi token investors can see common methods and tactics that have been used by fraudsters to engineer theft of funds. Since there is no regulation and the fact that most of the tokens are issued by anonymous entities, once defrauded, investors have no chance of recovering lost funds.
Rug Pulling Threatens Defi

&gt;In the medium to long term, continuing incidents of rug pulling will hurt the belief that decentralized finance can be the panacea to the longstanding problem of financial exclusion. Influencers and community leaders have an obligation to help fix these problems as doing this is the only way to maintain the public‚Äôs interest in Defi. More importantly, such an effort could help stave off regulators from imposing restrictive rules that curtail further growth of the space.",2020-10-13 12:07:13,Bitcoin,ja7ohs,soontobesilenced

1264,"Financial privacy is an essential element to fungibility in Bitcoin: if you can meaningfully distinguish one coin from another, then their fungibility is weak. If our fungibility is too weak in practice, then we cannot be decentralized: if someone important announces a list of stolen coins they won't accept coins derived from, you must carefully check coins you accept against that list and return the ones that fail. Everyone gets stuck checking blacklists issued by various authorities because in that world we'd all not like to get stuck with bad coins. This adds friction and transactional costs and makes Bitcoin less valuable as a money.

Financial privacy is an essential criteria for the efficient operation of a free market: if you run a business, you cannot effectively set prices if your suppliers and customers can see all your transactions against your will. You cannot compete effectively if your competition is tracking your sales. Individually your informational leverage is lost in your private dealings if you don't have privacy over your accounts: if you pay your landlord in Bitcoin without enough privacy in place, your landlord will see when you've received a pay raise and can hit you up for more rent.

Financial privacy is essential for personal safety: if thieves can see your spending, income, and holdings, they can use that information to target and exploit you. Without privacy malicious parties have more ability to steal your identity, snatch your large purchases off your doorstep, or impersonate businesses you transact with towards you... they can tell exactly how much to try to scam you for.

Financial privacy is essential for human dignity: no one wants the snotty barista at the coffee shop or their nosy neighbors commenting on their income or spending habits. No one wants their baby-crazy in-laws asking why they're buying contraception (or sex toys). Your employer has no business knowing what church you donate to. Only in a perfectly enlightened discrimination free world where no one has undue authority over anyone else could we retain our dignity and make our lawful transactions freely without self-censorship if we don't have privacy.

Most importantly, financial privacy isn't incompatible with things like law enforcement or transparency. You can always keep records, be ordered (or volunteer) to provide them to whomever, have judges hold against your interest when you can't produce records (as is the case today). None of this requires _globally_ visible public records.

Globally visible public records in finance are completely unheard-of. They are undesirable and arguably intolerable. The Bitcoin whitepaper made a promise of how we could get around the visibility of the ledger with pseudonymous addresses, but the ecosystem has broken that promise in a bunch of places and we ought to fix it. Bitcoin could have coded your name or IP address into every transaction. It didn't. The whitepaper even has a section on privacy. It's incorrect to say that Bitcoin isn't focused on privacy. Sufficient privacy is an essential prerequisite for a viable digital currency[2].

1. Miners happily and profitably run off of transaction fees alone. If bitcoin is widespread enough, fees wouldn't have to increase very much to make it worthwhile.

2. Mining has been delegated to autonomous not-for-profit mining rigs. If bitcoin has become important enough to humanity, people may come together to set up sustainably powered mining rigs that are there purely to secure the network, taking whatever fees are available but willing to operate without a profit if need be.

One thing's for sure though, we will see it coming decades away (I mean, we already see it coming) and it will be a slow transition.

Nodes verify transactions but they don't get any income in the first place (their incentive is to ensure privacy for their maintainer and minimize trust into third parties), so they won't care anyway.

1324,"&gt; I thought miners will be paid in bitcoin as a compensation for verifying the transactions  

No, there is a difference between ""verifying"" and ""mining"".  

Verifying can be done by anybody who wishes to, it doesn't require specialized, expensive hardware. This is akin to verifying if the gold coins you are receiving are real. You also can verify other things, like total coins issued and so on.  

Mining is something different. It's the process by which new transactions/new blocks get attached to the blockchain, and new coins are issued as the rewards. This process requires expensive, specialized hardware and is very competitive (you need access to cheap energy, space to store hardware etc).",2020-10-13 07:35:46,Bitcoin,j9oudz,TheGreatMuffin

1. if the miner waits to claim the block reward, some other miner could get it first, at which point the first miner winds up with nothing.
2. the solution that the miner found only applies to the current state of the block (at the time the miner found the solution). if the miner adds any transactions at that point, it would then need to solve the block all over again.",2020-10-13 02:51:26,Bitcoin,j9oudz,bitcoinisagoodthing

At the moment, I don't believe Kraken has an option that would allow less than a $4 fee for a $100 deposit. That said, the fees are coming from the Funding Providers. 

[Canada Post Funding](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027825511) and conversion into Bitcoin (after exchange fees) becomes less than 4% when you deposit greater than $150. The majority of the fee is eaten by Canada Post itself (3.95 of the roughly 6 CAD in fees)

Additionally, if you go through this route, I'd recommend placing [maker-type orders](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000526126-What-are-Maker-and-Taker-fees-), e.g. [limit buy orders](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/206899287-How-to-set-prices-for-limit-orders), as this saves .10% of the specified volume matched with another user placing a taker-type order, as you are the one providing liquidity.

FWIW, our Funding Team is adding new methods every month. [It's only getting easier in the future to provide options like ACH](https://blog.kraken.com/post/6241/kraken-wyoming-first-digital-asset-bank/).

You haven't disclosed much of your strategy, but DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) is generally not the worst idea.  

Although 4% fees sounds on the larger side, but depending on your method of acquisition this might be a premium on convenience. Still might be worth it to have a look around and try to find something with lower fees.

No, the block is hashed as the main part of the whole ""proof of work"" process. That hash serves for verification that the miner did the actual work, and the next block includes that hash to create a link between blocks (hence, ""blockchain"").  

But all the information within any given block gets broadcast and saved on every full node on the network, too. This includes every transaction within that block, plus newly issued coins and some metadata.

1388,"Take with a grain of salt, but here's my understanding of how HD wallets work:

They will generate x (apparently 1000 in this case) addresses, _from the last address that had activity_.

So on a new wallet with no transactions, you'll get 1,000 addresses. If you've received only one single transaction, on address #250, the wallet will then generate and check 1,000 addresses _from that address_.

This is designed to scale and work correctly, unless you have a huge number of addresses that go unused. In that particular instance, if you initialize a new wallet from the seed, you'll have to instruct it go check 2,000 addresses deep, or whatever the number is in your particular circumstance.

Update: I just tested sending some bitcoin to the 999 receiving address, creating a new blank wallet, and then setting the hdseed, but no addresses were generated further than the 999 address. Maybe all the addresses need to be used before it generates more?

Update: alright, the issue was that I haven't rescanned the blockchain and requested a new address. So, after rescanning the blockchain and using getnewaddress, it actually returned address 1,000 and generated the rest up to address 1,999!",2020-10-13 01:40:29,Bitcoin,j9vp15,alive_consequence

There are two things holding me back from just moving everything over to my Trezor:

* Privacy. Armory talks to _my_ Bitcoin Core node, and nothing else. Nobody else, anywhere, has any idea how much BTC I have.  Running my own Trezor backend would have a much heavier hardware footprint than Armory's backend.
* Coin Control. Armory will show me exactly what UTXOs I have, and I can select specific UTXOs for a transaction.

&gt; With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool
&gt; essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no
&gt; longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the
&gt; wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).
&gt; However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may
&gt; not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The
&gt; keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of
&gt; keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the
&gt; addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions
&gt; involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.
&gt; In the unlikely case where none of the addresses in the `gap limit` are
&gt; used on-chain, the look-ahead will not be incremented to keep
&gt; a constant size and addresses beyond this range will not be detected by an
&gt; old backup. For this reason, it is not recommended to decrease keypool size
&gt; lower than default value.",2020-10-13 03:58:58,Bitcoin,j9vp15,iancoleman

Of course specific software implementations would handle this differently, and probably enforce a gap limit, although this would only be a UI limitation of the software implementation, and doesn't change the underlying math.

1447,"Sorry if this is a stupid question, I‚Äôm very new to the crypto trading world. Why is it stupid to read Reddit for trading decisions? And what would you recommend doing instead?",2020-10-13 03:43:32,Bitcoin,j9wzbt,mpushkin2
1448,"No worries, we love new people.  Reddit is a terrible place for any advice really because for every good bit of advice you get expect a TON of bad advice.  

Typically with bitcoin an effective strategy is to buy a reasonable amount over and over on a long timeframe.  This is called dollar cost averaging.  Don't trade at all and ""hodl"" for a long time frame.  I plan on holding for decades and living a modest lifestyle and letting my grandchildren enjoy the bitcoin that I saved.  Hope this helps.",2020-10-13 04:12:34,Bitcoin,j9wzbt,cheese4brains
1449,"It does, thank you! I‚Äôve just invested into BTC, but was considering trying to day trade because a friend recommended it to me. With all the extra time I spend on the computer and at home because of covid, I thought it was a pretty good idea since I could monitor very frequently. What do you think?",2020-10-13 04:19:10,Bitcoin,j9wzbt,mpushkin2
1450,"The beauty of bitcoin is nobody can tell you how to use it.  If you want to trade, go for it.  Trading is extremely difficult and many smart people lose a lot of bitcoin they will never get back.  I don't have any advice because I've never sold a single sat.  There are some good traders on twitter like flood, dave the wave, and willy woo you might want to check out.

So that's it? Pretty basic from an algorithmic perspective. So nobody is using machine learning for blockchain trends analysis? Surely whales making large movements trigger trading decisions, all of which is a part of the BTC blockchain and available for public consumption from a trends analysis perspective.",2020-10-13 11:07:19,Bitcoin,j9wzbt,FrozzBozz
