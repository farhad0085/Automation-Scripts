28,jag76x,"I often post things here that really come across as fud, but what we have seen these last couple months is an explosion in regulator activity. The way the US federal government works, is it sits on cases for years at a time in secrecy, and then it attacks.

There are many obscure laws that people are all unaware of which entirely relate to the war on terror and 9/11 and the Patriot Act. The truth is that most of these banking laws that changed are a result of their pretense to behave like a police state under the guise of fighting terrorism. Well What does that have to do with bitcoin?

&amp;#x200B;

They want to set the precedence of those anti terrorism laws and banking laws onto end to end encryption and bitcoin. These people have a clear motive they are trying to keep hid, that crypto lawyer are beginning to speculate isn't off the table. They certainly implied in the DoJ 83 page report that those options are on the table. But the truth is, they \*already\* want to do it anyways.

Before I make the case for what I am alleging you need to know about the key regulatory bodies and some of these laws, which I'm just gonna list for you to research in case you doubt me:

1) OFAC 2)FATF 3)BIS 4)Interpol 5)Banking Secrecy Act 6)Treasury Department 7)Federal Reserve

Namely, What can the US do under OFAC in the guise of anti terrorism. Well the short answer is ANYTHING. And that is what this 83 page guide by Barr is claiming, that is what the Bitmex Indictment by the Department of Justice is claiming, that is what they have been doing in Afghanistan and Iraq for 20 years. It's been like this since 9/11 and now they are squaring in on crypto.

***It is clear that the Department of Justice and AG Barr do not want Bitcoin to function as Bitcoin, much like end to end encryption they want a back door***

But let's talk about what that ***looks*** like.

1) Forcing every country in the world to enforce mandatory KYC on all decentralized smart contracts and all centralized exchanges with the threat of extrajudicial indictment and OFAC black listing for Banking Secrecy Act violations and Terrorism funding.

2) Forcing every country to prohibit withdrawls to any non preregistered white listed address that has been vetted by CipherTrace and Chain Analysis with the threat as stated in 1)

3) Forcing every country to prohibit US customers from making an account without extremely profoundly high regulatory costs, thus trapping capital in the united states and prohibiting US citizen from investing overseas, as most modern Banks today will no longer take Americans as customers overseas, due to the same regulatory threats.

4) Forcing every merchant in America, and as many outside of America to use Chain Analysis and Cipher Trace on all transactions to vet the source of the funds, ***and if those funds do not have a chain of custody on a public blockchain linking back to a white listed kyced account, then rejecting those transactions (no more monero)***

5) Forcing every exchange in the world to do the same chain of custody verification on every customer just as above.

6) Disallowing any deposits in a US financial exchange to cash out without said chain of custody.

7) Disallowing any cash out of funds that have not been declared as owned assets in a perpetually pervasively monitored public address that the US regulatory bodies know about.

8) ***The constant threat of censorship and forced confiscation.***

9) ***The backdooring of all hardware wallets and software wallets, prosecution of developers. Indictments against Trezor and Ledgernano.***

10) ***Perpetual Surveilance***

37,ja2hwt,"TL;DR Libya is a cash-only society, where every merchant only deals in cash. There is no electronic banking system of debit cards, credit cards, or Interac machines -- just cash. But the banks ran out of cash. So, people can't buy anything because they can't access their funds because, remember, banks ran out of cash. Bitcoin would seem to solve every problem. How do we get Bitcoin into Libya?

Hey everyone,

First of all, full disclosure, I know very little about Bitcoin, or cryptocurrency in general, so as I make this post, please forgive any ignorance.

As a Libyan, we're seeing numerous challenges in our banking system in Libya (which, in all fairness, is just one of, many other, larger political issues if you happen to have been following Middle Eastern/Libyan news for the last decade).

The Central Bank of Libya has not had cash for an exceedingly long period of time, post 2011, which is problematic because Libya is a cash-only society. Every transaction, be it a house, or a loaf of bread, has always ever been transacted in cash only. While people do have bank accounts, with your account balance merely printed on paper, there has never been debit or credit cards in Libya. The only way one can access their funds from their bank account is by physically going to the bank and withdrawing cash. This is still the case today and, as you might have imagined, people have already long flooded the banks, and have depleted them of their reserves.

Consequently, the majority of Libyans have no access to their money in their accounts, and have only been at the mercy of when banks re-supply their reserves. In an attempt at maximizing the opportunity at every Libyan getting \*some\* cash, of course the bank imposes a depressingly low withdraw limit per person, who are all waiting in line-ups that are literally days long. Naturally, the bank's small reserve is instantaneously depleted, again and again, and if you were not of the lucky few to retrieve cash, then you go home with your tail between your legs and hope for a better next time.

The obvious solution to this would have been for the ""government"" to simply deploy an electronic system wherein Libya catches up to 21st century's earth-shattering technology: debit and credit cards, and Interac machines! Needless to say, this has not been done, yet, and we can very strongly assume that the ""government"" has no interest in doing this. I will not get into politics, or conspiracy here, but much of it leans in that direction. (Note: I put ""government"" in quotes because what I really mean is Libya doesn't exactly have a government, and the decision-makers are, essentially, foreign intelligence via domestic militia groups).

With all of that said, enter Bitcoin and my questions to the problems I wish to ask and wonder if Bitcoin solves:

(1) The first problem we have, of course, is that people are limited to cash to purchase food. However, if every merchant simply accepted Bitcoin, people can simply pay with their phones, without the need for cash. Everybody, and their grandmother, has a smartphone or two. Am I missing something here, or am I correct with the ease of use?

(2) The second problem we have is that nobody in Libya can be transferred money, from outside of Libya, even if Libyans had international friends and family willing to help them with money. But, with Bitcoin, you can simply transfer funds online with relative ease. Am I correct here, as well?

(3) I have no idea whether or not Bitcoin is currently available in Libya; furthermore, I have no idea whether or not Bitcoin is legal in Libya (and, frankly, if the aforementioned problems can be solved, nobody will care about its ""legality""). So, can Bitcoin be adopted in Libya, with relative ease, without necessitating the banking system or government? Or would this undertaking be a major project?

If possible, I would be very interested in working with anyone who can help make this a reality in all of Libya. I'm willing to do what's needed to be done (within my capabilities, of course), be it aggressive marketing/advertising, or otherwise. Thoughts, suggestions, help!

52,ja6x5m,"I don't have any bitcoin at the moment, but I'm interested in buying some. My buddy has bitcoin on robinhood and he said I can buy some too. I watched some YouTube video about buying a wallet so I went online at blockchain website and opened me a wallet. I also made an account on coinbase. My buddy said bitcoin is anonymous so the government can't find out if you own any. Now the questions are (my buddy couldn't answer them)

1. If I buy bitcoin on coinbase website, how is it anonymous? I literally had to provide my SSN and verify my identity. Doesn't that mean coinbase know it belongs to me? And if the government wanted to know if I have any bitcoin they can just ask coinbase? 

2. If transfer my bitcoin to a hardware wallet (my buddy told me about ledger website where I can buy me a flash drive wallet thing) won't there be traces of where the bitcoin came from and the person identity? Like if I transfer my bitcoin from coinbase to my hardware wallet there will be traces of the transfer right? Like banks? Or is this part anonymous? I know coinbase or the government isn't that dumb. If I transfer my bitcoin to a hardware wallet they know it was transfer from coinbase to a different wallet that presumably belongs to me..? 

3. Where can I buy bitcoin without providing my identity? 
4. Is it worth buying the ledger flash drive s? 
5. Why is bitcoin tied to country currency? What will happen to bitcoin value if the country currency is worthless?",Newbie with few questions,imstressedman,12,0,2020-10-13 10:57:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ja6x5m/newbie_with_few_questions/,25

Hello all, this is my first post on this subreddit. I will try to be informative and brief. 

7 of the worlds' central banks released a report on Friday, outlining their findings on CBDC (central bank digital currencies). In the 26 page document, neither Bitcoin nor any existing digital currency was mentioned once. The fundamental qualities that make bitcoin valuable stand in direct conflict with the desires a central bank would have in creating a digital currency (namely, to control the money supply). Therefore, why on earth are central banks considering the issuance of their own currencies? It is because they are finally seeing bitcoin as a direct threat to their power.",Central Banks are scared,mulebotte,44,0,2020-10-13 03:42:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ja09tj/central_banks_are_scared/,11

So because any bitcoin wallet (hot or cold) can generate as many addresses as the user desires I am wondering where exactly all those addresses lead? Since all these different addresses (generated by the same user from the same wallet in this example) bring received btc to the same place, where it’s compiled, is this “place” technically called a “ledger account”? 

If so then can wallets (hot and cold) essentially be considered the keeper of any given ledger account’s private keys as well the mechanism in which the ledger account is updated (when bitcoin is either sent or received from that ledger account)?",Bitcoin blockchain nomenclature,qualitycannabisnw,2,0,2020-10-13 13:29:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ja8q87/bitcoin_blockchain_nomenclature/,4

92,ja6rui,"Micheal Cohen stands as the Vice President of Global Operations at MyChargeBack, a consumer protection company. Cohen had given comment in regard to how fraudsters are taking advantage of crypto transactions, particularly their irreversible nature.

At its first envisioning, one of the key selling points of Bitcoin was how it would protect retailers even more than credit cards could. Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic founder of Bitcoin, gave a comeback to an early adopter’s complaint on an email on the 10th of October, 2008. The adopter, James A. Donald, complained that Bitcoin transactions weren’t instantaneously final.

Its Greatest Strength Being Turned To Weakness

In response, Satoshi highlighted the fact that paper checks can bounce following one or two weeks, with credit card transactions being capable of being contested for up to 60 to even 180 days after the fact. Bitcoin, Satoshi points out, is irreversible enough only after a few hours.

Cohen highlighted that, in some cases, a chargeback for credit cards are possible a full 18 months after the transaction was made. He further highlighted the two types of classification of credit card chargebacks: Unauthorized Use, and Authorized Use. Unauthorized, for example, is when a criminal illegally gains access to one’s credit card. Authorized, in turn, means when the cardholder themselves authorized the transaction, but they’re not satisfied with the outcome.


Cohen highlighted how, when it comes to crypto, consumers are only capable of recovering funds, should it be an unauthorized transaction. This is due to how credit companies, such as Visa or MasterCard, explicitly exclude certain industries from the authorized use category, such as gambling or crypto.

Crypto Scammers Are Like Grass In A Field

Much to Cohen’s dismay, he highlighted how crypto serves as such a convenient tool for scammers to collect funds, which are subsequently harming the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies. Cohen put it simply, highlighting that these people that got scammed through the use of crypto fraudsters, won’t be the ones that will promote the usage of cryptocurrency to others.

One of the most used tactics for these fraudsters, according to Cohen, is the offering of various services and products, typically related to forex trading. This is generally offered to an unsuspecting customer. At the last moment, the scammer eventually convinces the unsuspecting victim to pay for the service, or otherwise fund their new account by way of crypto.

Some Sliver Of Hope

Luckily for these victims, Cohen highlighted how not all hope should be lost. His company helps victims by identifying scammers, doing so by way of tracking the money movement in the blockchain. Typically, criminals opt to move to an exchange to cash out their crypto, and Cohen highlighted that many exchanges are quite eager to stamp these criminals out.",MyChargeBack Says Fraudsters Are Moving To Bitcoin From Credit Cards,cryptoanalyticatech,1,0,2020-10-13 10:46:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ja6rui/mychargeback_says_fraudsters_are_moving_to/,4

105,j9zy6k,"I've created a transaction validation program to sanity check btc transactions before and after signing (and before broadcasting). Below is the description of the overall protocol for doing a btc withdrawal from a wallet. The program does validation for steps #2 and #4.  Step #2 is designed to validate that Electrum is not compromised and is not generating malicious transactions. #Step 4 is designed to validate that the HW wallet is not compromised and is not generating malicious transactions.

Part of what it does is to identify whether addresses involved in the transactions are yours or not yours, and whether they are receive or change addresses, based on a set of named xpub keys that you put into a local config file, to prevent change address attacks and other attacks, and to just ensure you didn't accidentally choose the wrong address.

The program does not touch any private keys, only hd wallet master pub keys (xpub, zpub)

Trust minimized withdrawal protocol:

\#1. Generate candidate transaction in Electrum watch-only wallet, save as PSBT.

**#2. Validator, unsigned tx. - load PSBT into Validator. Verify Tx details (inputs, outputs, addresses, fee, amounts). Identify wallet ownership of any addresses involved in the tx (e.g. to validate that the change address actually belongs to your wallet). Display sha256 of PSBT File contents. If all looks good, Validator will copy the PSBT to the SD for signing. This step protects against a compromised version of Electrum generating a malicious transaction, and ensures only validated transactions come in contact with signing device.**

\#3. HW wallet. Verify sha256 hashes of PSBT file from Validator and as generated on HW device to ensure this PSBT is the same as the PSBT validated in step #2. Verify tx details. If good, sign PSBT.  Take note of signed tx file sha256 hash.

**#4. Validator, signed tx. Verify signed tx file sha256 hash matches HW device to ensure data integrity in transit. Re-verify tx details (inputs, outputs, addresses, fee, amounts), to protect against a compromised HW wallet firmware generating malicious transactions. If validation looks ok, Validator will send tx bytes to full node for broadcasting.**

""What if this whole process were automated with cryoptographically-enforced trust, \[...\]. If the flight is on time, the smart contract pays itself.""

How will ""cryptographically-enforced trust"" be any different from what we currently have? Is not this problem more about to be able to automatically identify that in fact a flight delay occurred, rather than being able to trust that it occurred? I mean, if the flight is delayed, that is an undeniable fact that it is possible to handle with non-blockchain technology.

How would you see this problem being solved with blockchain?

148,j9tfq8,"Hey guys, i'm following this Blockstack project for a long time and recently there have been a lot of progress/updates and really god news, also for BTC holders.

Recently they've launched phase 3 Krypton: proof-of-transfer (PoX) implementation on the Stacks 2.0 testnet which is huge thing because it makes possible to Stack Stacks (yeah, i know) STX tokens thus securing the Stacks blockchain (acting as a validator) and get BTC reward for that.

Most important is the new consensus mechanism [Proof-of-Transfer (PoX](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e7b1a27d160ce49af1c24e1/5f1596b12bcc0800f3dcadcd_pox.pdf)) leverages Bitcoin’s security to secure the Stacks blockchain, and combined with Clarity Smart contracts, PoX eliminates the choice between flexibility and security.

For those who interested more in project is suggest you to read this [article](https://blog.blockstack.org/krypton-launch-proof-of-transfer-now-implemented-on-the-stacks-2-0-testnet/) for better understanding.

All in all i am really excited about this mutually beneficial link between BTC and STX which leads to a whole new level of DeFi. Their testnet is on last stages and mainnet will soon be live (in a month as i recall), id really sugest you to follow this.",Defi on Bitcoin.,Denice89,1,0,2020-10-12 21:53:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/j9tfq8/defi_on_bitcoin/,0
