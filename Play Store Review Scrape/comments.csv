"Game is nice and calming, but ads could be shorter. Penguins live in Antarctica and reindeers, foxes, rabbits, polar bears doesn't live there",4,2020-06-07 15:06:30
"Very beautiful game. Really relaxing. My gripe with it is that the game drains battery too much, and is too ad-realiant. Don't get me wrong, watching ads to support devs is great. But with this game, I feel like bonuses or anything that will substantially help with progress is behind ads",4,2020-06-07 14:52:34

"Very cute game. I especially like the graphics. The various penguins have been modelled and animated realistically. The development mechanics are satisfying and the music is soothing. Sadly in order to keep playing you'll need to be constantly watching ads. They aren't too obnoxious but there is no way around it, unless you want to pay loads. There comes a point in the game where the development of your island stagnates (before the whale nest) and it's frustrating. Quite nice overall..",4,2020-06-07 06:05:46
Cute fun great game,5,2020-06-07 05:59:47
The game is very ad intensive. No option in any form to turn off ads. Goes completely against the concept of a chill game.,1,2020-06-07 05:25:36
"Calm and relaxing game. The background music is very soothing. The app makes the phone very hot after awhile though, so simply letting it run is not an option, unfortunately.",4,2020-06-07 05:18:22

"Very fun game, can be quite addictive! Downloaded it when I was using a loaner phone and didn't have data on the go but kept playing it once I got my new phone. It is easy to unlock new stuff, and once you get your Penguins working for you while you're away from the phone, you will gain a ton of gold, Penguins, other animals, and areas (fishing hole, theme park, flower garden etc)",5,2020-06-07 04:01:19

I show everyone at work my penguins. Its the first and only game I've ever spent money on (I bought the triceratops penguin) and its worth it. Who needs therapy when you got these cute little guys!,5,2020-06-07 01:35:10

"Ads should not be longer than 15 seconds. All the math just doesn't add up right. Phone gets really hot when playing. Otherwise kinda fun. You can't loose, that's nice. I wonder what the devs ad revenue is. Must be off the charts.",2,2020-06-06 08:57:36

Relaxing music and ambience disturbed by irrelevant ads. Sick of these ads. Ruins game,1,2020-06-06 06:26:20
The game is good. It has very good graphics and sound. But it's just a repetitive task of getting coin and upgrading. Wanted to give 3.5 but it does deserve 4 star for the amount of hard work put into developing it.,4,2020-06-06 04:45:31

Great game. Great concept. Everything is perfect except for some minor bugs for example if you get a challenge that forces you to open 5 gift boxes. Sometimes ships and other stuff counts as those boxes and the ads are kinda annoying after a while. Othereise it's a great game with great smooth gameplay. Good job 😁👍,4,2020-06-05 23:00:57

"They hit you with those sweet, sweet microtransactions instantly",1,2020-06-05 04:57:01
Adorable game! A lot of love and effort has gone into this and it shows. Please keep developing this because it's beautiful. It's relaxing and entertaining - such great characters. There is a good level of progression compared to the amount of ads you watch. I hate the TikTok ads tho because they pull you out of Penguin Isle and open play store automatically.,5,2020-06-05 02:58:11

It's good peaceful but you have to wait for cash and do nothing I hope there's events are mini games to pass the time but out of all of that I like this app,4,2020-06-03 20:53:58
"This game has a really pretty aesthetic, but imo has too many ads. It basically requires you to watch ads to progress with upgrades, due to its having four currencies (each only usable in one or two contexts). I would be ok with this, except that somehow whoever made this expects you to spend $30/month to get rid of the ads and still get the rewards. This seems incredibly unreasonable",3,2020-06-03 19:43:48

"Basic math is wrong. When buying a penguin, the game says gold production will increase ""by 150%"". I have 500 gold/second before buying. Increasing 500 by 100% would be 500+500, increasing by 150% would be 500+750 (total of 1250). Bought penguin and new gold/second is a total of 750. This is an increase of/by 50% (+250) not 150% (+750). Is this a mistake?",2,2020-06-03 12:44:15

"I think it's the best game I've ever played, with time you get to realize about some techniques to progress more and that's absolutely amazing. I'm here once more just to make some small suggestions that I'd love to see: Better distribution of penguins around the island not just staying in the middle, more visual improvements when upgrading habitats, another way to increase heart production and, finally, be able to connect with Facebook. Nevertheless, still being an amazing game. <3",5,2020-06-01 23:07:33

"Cool game, I like it very much. Though it would be great for new users to be able to play previous events and get those decorations and characters, maybe you could make it happen somehow, that would be nice. Another thing, why is it not possible to have all the penguins in the game at once, for now I can only have 18/24 of each kind of common penguins on the game field.

"I think more appropriate name for this game would be ""Ad watching with penguins"". That's basically what you do, watch many, many ads, and sometimes build something. Then watch many more ads, and maybe build something. Shame, it definitely has a potential.",1,2020-06-01 19:44:37

This is the best app made to kill time.. you can become a mathematician soon by counting coins and hearts... this build patience as well. Thanks a lot for making this app. It's even more great since you can play it offline without spending money. However it would be great if you could bring each level's score down ( the amount of coins we have to earn to reach each level. Bcz you have set higher targets which are not easy to achieve sometime). Thanks anyway.,5,2020-06-01 18:42:10
"This game is so cute!! Those penguins are amazing!! You don't have to stay 10 hours to get some money, if you collect everything you feel rich! I love the game because its just so cute, relaxing and it just makes your day better <3",5,2020-06-01 18:07:09

One of the best mobile games I've played,5,2020-06-01 07:52:47
Its a nice and calm game and there are no ads like in other game.You can Play it while watching youtube or in the Bus or At class when the lessons are Boring. The music is calm and the Penguins and animations are really good. I recommend this game for people that just wanna calm done.,5,2020-06-01 06:04:01

This is a very relaxing and fun game,5,2020-05-31 23:23:38
cute,5,2020-05-31 23:05:17
The best game to play when you are bored or sad. The most exiting thing is that the penguins move around and visit each habitats looks cute. I request the developer of this app to bring such an app of dinosaurs or animals.,5,2020-05-31 22:00:07
Its fun and I'm enjoying it but now two of my penguins were randomly deleted. I put in effort watching all those ads to max out all my penguins and I sign on today and I only have 18 instead of 20? Only issue and complaint everything else is 100%,4,2020-05-31 20:36:26
i hope updates come fast. i finished the game and waiting!!,3,2020-05-31 20:00:04

Cute,5,2020-05-31 16:58:07
It is very nice game the graphics are good sound tracks are good and you also become addicted to built your penguin society but after playing for months I got bored but it's still a nice game. There should be some side quests to make the game more interesting.,4,2020-05-31 15:47:28
Since the last update the offline reward is broke. I get 2 br money from treasure ship and only 4 br from offline for 660 minutes which is not at all correct. Also the hearts reward once you are at 100% double with the help of the animals you should get that in the reward as well.,3,2020-05-31 13:24:57
"It's cute and the music is soothing. But I think the best part is how they use ads. You can choose to view ads for benefits. As far as I can tell, ads aren't forced on you at any point. It makes me excited to see ads, because I get to choose when to see them and I'm going to get some coins out of it. Awesome game.",5,2020-05-31 12:22:08
Lovely graphics. I'm sure an enjoyable tappable experience for some to many. To each their own. Kudos to the developers with best wishes.,2,2020-05-31 10:58:47
"Great game overall, very calming and cute. But ads aren't loading or take a really long time to load, which is really annoying!",4,2020-05-31 09:33:30
I love it so much. I am constantly playing and taking care of my little penguins,5,2020-05-31 07:44:37

I LOVE THIS GAME!! There aren't too many ads and the penguins are soooo cute! Although the ad coupons and some packs are way too expensive for what you get the cheap ones are worth it!,4,2020-05-31 05:40:47

"ABSOLITELY AMAZING. Love it so much, im so addicted",5,2020-05-31 01:43:33
"To be honest, I've always hated these tycoon games because it was so boring and they were like cookie clicker games. But, this game is not like the others. The photo feature is really nice and the penguins are cute. The island that this game takes place on is aesthetically pleasing. I love how the penguins interact with each place differently and sometimes even take decorations and put them in the middle of the island. The music also enhances the calming experience. 10/10 would recommend.",5,2020-05-31 01:00:07
Sometimes the ads freeze up and i have to restart the whole app,4,2020-05-31 00:40:42

The best game ever made🤩💙👌👍👏❄️🌨️🐧,5,2020-05-30 03:19:48
"After you play for a week or so things get a tad boring. There are no exciting bits of the game. You simply log in after your MAX offline coin, watch a video to double it, watch ANOTHER video for the ship, watch ANOTHER video for the gift box, then logout to do it all again 2 hours later",1,2020-05-30 01:50:01
"Cute, calming, relaxing; however, I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for its difficulty to unlock new habitats, creatures, or to do quests and the like because it's too expensive or takes too much time.",3,2020-05-30 00:22:26
I love this app because I love penguins and I love seeing them be happy and making fun stuff for them,5,2020-05-29 21:17:25

"Great game! I would recommend it to my friends and family. But, I need more cute penguins. I hope the game updates soon with more penguins. I wish when you're upgrading a habitat you can long press the upgrading button to upgrade faster. But, so far I love the game!",5,2020-05-29 20:00:09
It's good,5,2020-05-29 19:35:02
I loved everything about this game.,5,2020-05-29 18:02:55
It is really calming and settling when your about to go to bed and sleep. I always play this before I sleep and accasionly so that us why I gave this a five star rating.,5,2020-05-29 17:06:48
I have to say this is the best phone game I've ever played. I'm disappointed because I'm at the end now and can't find anything at the same level.,5,2020-05-29 14:58:01

I personally find it really relaxing.,5,2020-05-29 12:22:25
What's the point of habitat revolution upgrade? It only gives you upgrade boost once an upgrade of it not every time I upgrade the habitat itself. The habitat upgrade only gives you 10% upgrade every time. It means it's better if I upgrade the habitat first until I feel bored of upgrading it and then upgrade the habitat revolution lump sum. It's better if you make the habitat revolution upgrade gives the overall upgrade for the habitat. That way I wouldn't feel of it as a waste.,3,2020-05-29 12:04:27
"Rather relaxing because of it's artstyle/colours and music/sfx which is good. However, everytime I see this game it reminds me of ads and waiting. Its gameplay does not outshine those two factors which means youll get bored of it easily because theres nothing else you can do than to wait to be able to do something even with ads. You wait for ads, watch ads and still waiting. It'll be best if there is some active mechanic within the game like mini games or deeper interactions with the penguins",3,2020-05-29 10:40:59

So relaxing and adorable!!!,5,2020-05-28 21:28:51
"It would have been fun. When I saw the ridiculous prices, I had to say no. A monthly subscription to get rid of ads? Haha. It's just another idle game I don't need. Also k(kilo) is the standard abbreviation for 1000. But they use ""a"". ????",1,2020-05-28 20:34:45
Very well done game with nice visuals. However the game is not finished. I have ran out of Quests and Habitats. I guess that means there is no reason to continue playing.,2,2020-05-28 19:22:47
"I like it! It gets a little repetitive after a while, and it gets pretty difficult to but new habitats. But it is very relaxing",4,2020-05-28 19:22:15
Amazing and addictive,5,2020-05-28 19:04:00
"Beautiful and just downright soothing, but please add names for the penguins: quirks, personalities, relationships, and maybe conflicts within the pack. Sprinkle some individuality to each of them so they'll be fun to watch.",3,2020-05-28 15:01:24

Cute time wasting game,5,2020-05-27 09:49:39
"Nice game, but I would say it would be really great if the penguins were not fully grown when we create them. That would give a better feeling of seeing them grow from a baby penguin to an adult penguin.",4,2020-05-27 09:39:59
"The phone heats up when playing this game. I'm using one plus 7T. I play other games like pubg call of duty for hours, but the phone doesnt heat up. If I play this game for 15-20mins straight, phone get extremely hot.",2,2020-05-27 09:31:52

企鹅很可爱，游戏很休闲，但是游戏背景是在北极是什么鬼？？🤔 不去刻意升级就不会跟广告打遭遇战，(不点广告就想升级是不可能的，这辈子都是不可能的哈哈)但是看广告得挂vpn啊啊啊！ 另外，发展多了之后在游戏里呆久了会变得略卡，机身发烫(我的机子是845的)，希望开发者能调教调教再优化些。 以及bakery升级之后外观没有变化，应该是个bug，开发者记得更新噢！ 虽然有各种缺点，但是满足了休闲养宠物的心，8错啦！,5,2020-05-27 07:14:49

"Love the game, relaxing to play and full of challenges. The gameplay style is simple but I think this helps a lot as other games I've played put so much detail in to everything that it kinda washed out the enjoyability of the game. One of the few games I've found that don't push you to pay with money, even without watching ads you can progress well. Well dont the to developers. love the game.",5,2020-05-26 19:41:49

the song is so calm you can create your own village you can take photos when you take a photo you can put the camera in the water but you will need I lot of money for things if you see a love heart near the penguin tap it and if you see a photo on a penguin press it I mean press the camera near the penguin,5,2020-05-26 10:50:34

I loved this game until the advertisement for golf clash glitched it out everytime it came up. It causes the game to have to be closed and restarted. How could something so simple be overlooked?,1,2020-05-26 08:23:42
The game was superb. The only thing is it became repetitive. It would be cool if you make a friend list system something like that so we can visit other island and and other quest.,3,2020-05-26 08:15:00
"Very cool n everything but is there a way we can watch 5 minute ads every once in a while instead of watching a 30sec ad every 2 minutes? Like, let's say if I watch 5 full minutes of ads I can then open the next 10 or 15 gifts/boxes for free without waiting, it would be cool.",5,2020-05-26 08:06:12

"I really, really love this game and I've been playing it for months. However a lot of the joy has been taken out of it for me because it is impossible to upgrade anything. The quests are always ""upgrade fishing to x level"" and it takes days to get enough gold to go up one level. I can't afford to autoproduce gold at my newest area because I don't have enough hearts even though I've had it for three months. It's stopped me from playing because it's so unattainable.",3,2020-05-26 02:03:47
"Lovely game, this is beautiful.",5,2020-05-26 02:02:55
"This is basically a game watch-ads-to-play. The progression it's stupidly slow *unless* you watch an ad, which gives you a lot of resources.",2,2020-05-26 01:12:08
A very good game 10 out of 10,5,2020-05-26 00:07:10
Penguins are super cute. But it takes wayyyyyyy toooooo long to gather enough gold to level up and buy things. At one point the game became boring because I cannot seem to afford to upgrade anything.,2,2020-05-25 23:29:00

"I would give this game a good rating because it's very calm, relaxing and it makes me happy. Of course that comes with some downsides such as it's hard to progress without going idle or everything gets really expensive.",4,2020-05-25 17:42:41

Just relaxing and fun to play :),5,2020-05-25 16:14:30
"Entertaining and soothing, it offers a much-needed break from all the zombie and human killing that i do in the other games that i play. Absolutely free to play! There are a lot of ads though, and they can sometimes be repetitive (showing the same ad numerous times in a row), but it's not even close to being a deal-breaker for me. Some of the Quests can take awhile to complete (i.e. collecting penguin hearts) but the pace of the game allows you to progress slowly but surely.",4,2020-05-25 16:00:01

"Quite addictive game. But once you reach a Level where you collect coins in the Range of AQ , the game moves quite too slow and there's no other way to keep you going through the game for long time.. but still the game is good in terms of graphics, audio and visuals..",4,2020-05-25 13:46:43

I love it very fun to play no bugs really cute,5,2020-05-25 06:57:26
Really Fun to begin with loved collecting all the breeds of penguin but late game it become very boring. It takes for ever to upgrade as the rates at which you earn coins make no sense. 20.66 at/sec ? Then why do I only get 18.56 au after 5 hours and 360 au when I PAY for a 6 hour time token.....?? And theres less and less you can do other than come on watch ads and get off. Seems like a pay to play games after a while.,2,2020-05-25 06:51:01
Very chill game I have played,4,2020-05-25 05:52:59

good game but with the new update we have more decoration to place but still only 30 space add more that would be cool :),4,2020-05-25 00:42:18
"It is very calming and i was comforted by those penguins' activities. The image design is too cloudy for me, there are too much mist that it's all appeared snowy light blue. So, it is calming. That's it. I don't feel fun but only that calm feeling so sometimes it's not my to-go game if i am bored",4,2020-05-24 23:57:22

Love the animation and the relaxation it has. Recommended for anyone who wish to see cute transition. Hope can place more decoration items rather than only 30 items.,5,2020-05-24 18:25:14
The Game told me to leave a review,5,2020-05-24 18:17:33
Nice peaceful game,5,2020-05-24 15:06:45
"Really well made idle clicker. Solid graphics, good sound. It's very stable overall. All in all a fun game to pick up and play. Lots of little surprises. It gives you a lot of freedom in doing upgrades. The photo system is a nice touch. The overall sense of progression is visible as you get more penguins, upgrades and new creatures. 5/5 for creative penguin design alone.",5,2020-05-24 14:46:02
too addictive,1,2020-05-24 14:28:35
"it's a really soothing game, I absolutely love my adorable penguins! but it's kinda hard to progress in the game since the max offline time is only 120mins, I mean I don't want to be constantly checking the game/ time to get my offline amount of coins and stuff. can developers please consider putting the offline time as long as we're offline so we can get the actual amount of stuff? it would really enhance my game experience~ also THE DINO PENGUIN ITS SO CUTE EVEN THOUGH I HAVENT GOTTEN IT YET!!",4,2020-05-24 13:35:06
Fun game and cool!,5,2020-05-24 13:32:16

this game is so fun,5,2020-05-24 11:30:51
Penguin Isle is a very soothing game. The music is calming. The penguins being all derpy doing penguin stuff are adorable. A cute way to kill time.,5,2020-05-24 09:02:24
So far its fun and calming. Will update later.,4,2020-05-24 07:47:37
I enjoyed it as a nice idle game but to get ahead in any timely manner you would have to buy more stuff all time.,2,2020-05-24 07:18:48
"I really like it! The graphic of the icebergs and the penguins are very cute and amazing. Though controlling the way the camera could be better, I still love it.",4,2020-05-24 06:53:08
"A cute idea with cute graphics, but too clunky and slow for a game of this type. I've only tried playing it a couple times, but both times I experienced huge lag/slowdowns doing very normal gameplay. Maybe I just have too many apps or background tasks going on my phone, but no other app I use gets this sluggish this often.",2,2020-05-24 06:49:08
This is the best game everrrrrrr too calming and beautiful but it's kinda slow sometimes and i have a request tho the game would be more fun if we can drag the penguins anywhere and play with them a little just like a pet :( i hope you make more games with this concept thanks for such a masterpiece💜,5,2020-05-24 05:42:31
Ummm... No joke sorry habby I thought this was something I hate called Kick the Dummy you'll probably never read this but I think I am getting so frustrated of fake ads,5,2020-05-24 04:42:37
Love the game. It super calming and I don't know why I didn't download it earlier! If anyone sees this comment who hasn't downloaded this game then download the game!,5,2020-05-24 03:15:11

very relaxing and it keeps you engaged unlike some other of these type of game,5,2020-05-23 21:42:04
I just adore this game. Its so cute and I love how each penguin is so animated💗🐧,5,2020-05-23 21:32:06
Some of the ultra rare achievements are not showed as achieved or even the percentage of cof completion is not yet raised since a month though I completed the task/ goal. I found that disappointing.,2,2020-05-23 20:04:56
"Really fun and cute the first 3 days then it gets quite boring actually... same thing over and over, youre basically just clicking bottons...and that's it. BUT it is cute UwU",3,2020-05-23 18:53:00
"Cute penguins and a fun game but the math makes no sense. Gold and percentages seem arbitrary. Upgrade numbers don't add up, neither does the money letter system. Just isn't fun after a while because there's no strategy involved, it's just whatever they want you to be at and the longer you go, the more you'll have to pay to even get close to some of the achievements. As well, the longer you play, the longer it takes ads to load so you'll wait 30 seconds for the button and 25 more for the ad.",2,2020-05-23 18:48:18
"I love it, you should do more games like this with other animals or even make a zoo tycoon kind of game. Lots of people love those type of games",5,2020-05-23 17:48:04

No real directions. Hard to know what to do. And game glitches,2,2020-05-23 08:47:53
"I really like the concept of the game. For me it just feels very therapeutic overall(apart from the ads). Although it's becoming progressively harder to upgrade, its still really calming to play. I especially like the soundtrack incorporated as it further strengthens the overall ""peaceful"" atmosphere of the game. I love this game that's why I'm giving it 5 stars :))",5,2020-05-23 08:11:31
I like this game the fact that I love penguins I'll play it,5,2020-05-23 08:05:13
"The graphics and sound are excellent, and the interface is clean and intuitive. But in the end the game mechanics make me feel like I'm just an automaton being trained to click on certain buttons to get virtual points that allow me to upgrade systems that produce more virtual points, and so on… It felt empty, gratuitously addictive, and too limited after a while. Maybe if I was able to play with the environment I was building (make the penguins do stuff, for example) it would be more engaging.",4,2020-05-23 06:46:48
"Wonderful game, beautiful artwork! Just one thing needed for 5 stars, is it possible to add scroll bars on the diferent game windows? For a better user friendly experience, like in habitat and penguin lists. Thank you for all your work!",4,2020-05-23 06:02:00
It's kinda cool because it has penguins. I'm kidding it's absolutely adorable. Easy 5 stars,5,2020-05-23 04:59:59

Constant ads. Graphics deserve a better game.,1,2020-05-23 01:27:47
"Giving it a low rating because I have to watch 3 ads to complete 1 quest and it is only going to get worse as I progress. It is also a bit boring just click and wait. Good graphics, penguins are cute.",2,2020-05-23 01:20:53
The center of life,5,2020-05-22 23:58:40
Very nice relaxing game,5,2020-05-22 21:58:33
It's ok. Eats a lot of battery and heats up the phone (I've played on 3 phones). You can't listen to music while playing (disrupted when watching ads that I usually mute anyway). Also it takes forever to collect over 1000 hearts - why can't we somehow increase how often they appear? It takes me days..because I can't have the game open for too long (because of the heat and battery),3,2020-05-22 21:45:17
Its not that good,2,2020-05-22 21:35:42

I'd like to be able to hide the many UI elements as they aren't very peaceful but otherwise a fine game.,4,2020-05-21 21:29:02
This is my new favourite game i like that the only ads i get are for rewards and you get rewards for being offline the only reason im giving this 4 stars is because its a bit laggy and its hard to zoom out and scroll up & down i woud love to see my penguins and creature's go into the sea and swim close to the island,4,2020-05-21 19:29:35
I thought I would not like it but it's actually a lot of fun,5,2020-05-21 18:26:13

"amazing game ; it helps with my depression and anxiety by calming me down, the music is relaxing and the graphics are perfect for a game like this - but, i hate ad placements, when i get the boxes(?) they're annoying, i don't know if i can remove them at all because im new, and i hate cluttered spaces so it's very annoying seeing them, and i have to watch the ads or else they'll stay there and clutter up. and the ads disturb the gameplay and ruin it for me - otherwise, it's awesome",4,2020-05-21 15:05:39

"Pretty. Good graphics. Peaceful. But boring about 5 islands in. First few are easy then just boring. Literally 4 days of; open app, click 4 things (watch 3 ads or more) get a bit of coin but not enough to open next island. Hardly any game play. Watch adds for no reward. Been trying to open new islands over a week now and can never get enough coin (without spending cash). Opening an app once a day to click 3 things is quite boring.",2,2020-05-21 02:18:48

OK but stopped increasing when buying penguins. Few bugs,2,2020-05-19 20:59:21
It was quite fun. But it got boring pretty fast because it was just always the same few things over and over again.,4,2020-05-19 20:43:52
"Nice relaxing game but put down the pirse of the land scape and them when you get far on the game, put a little higher.",4,2020-05-19 19:35:40

Nice tap game! Scene and sounds are soothing!,5,2020-05-19 19:28:04
"i love this game way too much, its so addictive and calming. penguins are my favorite now because of this. but as a healing game, i personally dont enjoy the ads much. its understandable for games to have ads but most of them are so disruptive to the calmness of the game. yes, i know, i can turn off the ads audio but before that im gonna get spooped. i wouldnt mind if the devs can somehow fix this, and please dont ruin it by ""in-app purchases"". thank you",5,2020-05-19 18:54:59
When i start the game suddenly restrat,1,2020-05-19 18:45:59
This game is cool This game is too too good,5,2020-05-19 16:32:17
The ads game,3,2020-05-19 16:24:02
The game is sooo cool but every time i get unlimited money,5,2020-05-19 15:32:46
"It was such a good game, I want everyone to play this. And also in the next update can You make a farm habitat?, I really wish to have a farm in it",5,2020-05-19 15:31:50

I have opened so many chests... Yet in the reward section for opening the chest is still not Updating... Not able to progress. Request support. Thanks.,3,2020-05-19 13:27:32
Literally the greatest game I've ever played. It is penguins people. You get money for taking pictures of penguins. Download it.,5,2020-05-19 11:47:49
Just amazing,5,2020-05-19 11:27:02
Complicated game to win.,5,2020-05-19 11:04:26
Good game so far,5,2020-05-19 10:53:47
Nice game,5,2020-05-19 09:45:10
"Not bad, one of the idle games that doesn't have a prestige in it. The offline rewards are limited and cannot be collected, unless you have a connection. Progress is quite fast but only if youre online",4,2020-05-19 08:35:29
Enjoyed how calm the game was and the penguins were awesome,5,2020-05-19 07:45:29
Wasn't really interesting or have anything you can do except tap penguins. Only had it for like a day,3,2020-05-19 07:20:50
ok,5,2020-05-19 06:41:13
It's alright. Its gets a but boring in the long run. I like tycoon games and this spread yo be one of them. I enjoyed the aesthetic and loved the interaction I could have with the penguins. But after a while It became more of a chore to play instead of a leisure. Maybe I was missing something. But overall it was alright. I had fun while it lasted.,3,2020-05-19 03:57:16
amazing game I love penguins,5,2020-05-19 02:30:24
"I love this game, I would recommend the game to anyone.",5,2020-05-18 22:42:26
"Addictive, fun and nice music which I could listen to all day, even some of the adverts are information about different penguins which is interesting. Great game thank you",5,2020-05-18 22:28:23
Oh my God this is the best anti stress games and it just looks so happy,5,2020-05-18 20:05:33
"The last update added great features and made the game better. However, the penguin section looks very strange now. In my opinion, there is a mess with numbers. For example, one kind of the penguin is 20/20, and I can buy more of them. Another kind of the penguin is 19/24, and it is max. I can't get the logic.",4,2020-05-18 19:45:15
"This is my favorite idle game, so it's perfect if you like those! My only complaint is that the red gift boxes give a ridiculously small amount of coins. I'm on 3.11aj, and my latest box gave me 5.39i, at this point I'm just watching the ads to get rid of them, not for the reward. Everything else is super well-balanced, though! Great game overall.",5,2020-05-18 17:53:33
For me its ok only thing i dont like about this game is its hard to earn hearts,3,2020-05-18 17:43:15
Pleasant experience so far!!,5,2020-05-18 15:31:11
Actually i love this game... It's very satisfying.. the way which penguin moves is so realistic... It's live we are making a Isle and growing creatures... Lovely... But I can't get new upgrade.. the major update that Ferris wheel thing.. and one more request pls make it little bit easy to buy whale's nest... It's different to buy... Do consider my review... Thank you...,4,2020-05-18 15:23:47
Hi my son went offline for 600 minutes and he did not get the arctic hair. I want to know what happened there?,1,2020-05-18 14:05:03

This game learning you about penguins too!!,5,2020-05-17 00:42:46
It's a great game but getting Whale Nest is too hard. It's gotten to the point where I can barely upgrade anymore. Watching the ads for the offline rewards and the treasure ship give me enough money to upgrade maybe 6 times. I've been stuck trying to get Whale Nest for nearly 2 months. Aside from that though I really do enjoy this game it's great,4,2020-05-16 22:42:23
"Fun little time-wasting game, I feel like the ads pop up too often but also you don't have to tap them if you don't want to.",4,2020-05-16 21:20:59
Relax 🤤,5,2020-05-16 18:25:15
Its a good game though. Got stuck in camera mode had to quit out once in about a week.,4,2020-05-16 18:20:15

Its lovely.,5,2020-05-16 08:20:06
This game is awesome but I think you should make a one where there is a bunch of Demogorgons and it called Demogorgon isle and it should take place in the upside down I think that would be awesome 😁 (this all is from a show called stranger things,5,2020-05-16 08:12:53
Really cute and fun,5,2020-05-16 06:07:32
Dope game honestly simple yet satisfying,5,2020-05-16 05:08:24

"The pace is very slow and boring I was falling asleep waiting for penguins and other items to produce and there is a lot all going on at all at once, the camera is annoying wanting to always take shots. It's a good idea and could be a game I might get in to but it's all too slow and drowsy..",3,2020-05-16 03:32:59

"I usually don't write reviews for games but after reading the other opinions on here and seeing that the developers actually look in, I figured why not. This is probably the most fun casual game I've planned in a while. The funny thing about it is my 3 year old daughter downloaded this game. I picked it up one day to see what she was doing and haven't put it down. I would like to see more physical upgrades when you do upgrade an environment because it does take a while to upgrade.

Cant stop playing it. It's so addictive. Almost too addictive😂,5,2020-05-11 13:49:45
I like the game a lot. Its really relaxing but I have a few problems with it. For example right now I require 10n hearts to make the danger shore produce gold automatically but I only can receive aroind 4m hearts in one hour. The jump between the costs is just too big. And I also wish for the island to be not so far apart. Most of the time you can barely see the reindeer or lighthouse. It would be great if we could customizer our island more.,4,2020-05-11 13:34:29
I love this game and the penguins are so cute so i rate five,5,2020-05-11 13:34:04

"Amazing game, Amazon upgrades relaxing Game.",5,2020-05-11 10:44:57
"This game is amazing! Also very satisfying when you just focus on the penguins and creatures just doing their thing in the island. This game definitely deserves a 5 star rating. Good job developers! By the way there can improvements to the game. Maybe add a shop for basic decoration so that players can spend time decorating the island while waiting. The game can also have a buy space for decoration feature because 30 space isn't really enough for decoration. Awesome developers, keep it up!👍",5,2020-05-11 10:31:08
"The graphics are really cute and simple, and the concept of how to play the game is also really simple and easy to understand, which is nice. However, the game lagged a lot on my device to the point where it got so bad that I had to delete it. EDIT: I added one star because of how quick the developers responded to my review. Nice!",4,2020-05-11 10:24:37
It's a really amazing game to I guess just chill and watch some penguins live their life.,5,2020-05-11 09:18:17

Such a relaxing and peaceful little game 💙💙,5,2020-05-10 23:34:15
This app loves draining my tablets battery I was wondering if you could add a power saving mode to the game. There is also another thing that I want for the game and that is to be available to download on Hoozo tablets. If that happens then I'll love this app even more. Can there be a way to transfer data from iOS to Android without Facebook Twitter or Instagram? Just a suggestion,4,2020-05-10 23:07:18
"Dear Developer, I love this game,it is very realxing, but I have an issue I am not sure how to make the Penguins like the Gardner etc produce gold own their own without tapping on the gold button again and again...please help.",5,2020-05-10 22:30:51

It's a great game without any interrupting ads. Are there going to be any more updates in the future to add more habitats?,5,2020-05-10 15:24:55
Game is charming at first but quickly begins to have problems. Boosts don't calculate properly. By the time I got level 15 it was glitching so bad I could not longer play. Force closed and level 15 points wouldn't even calculate. Cute concept but needs major work.,1,2020-05-10 11:27:24
Tycoon games are... Not good for you,1,2020-05-10 10:45:29
A bit laggy and it takes you a lot of time to buy or upgrade something. Almost everything requires watching ads and ya its a Pay2Win Simulator Game...,2,2020-05-10 09:46:21

"This game is an ad farm and the developers know it. It lures you in for a while until it literally would take a week or more to level up if u wish to not spend money. Before you know it, all you do is watch ads and you'd realise what a time waster it is.",2,2020-05-09 14:44:08

"Hello developers, I have come to enjoy this game for its adorable settings and smooth graphics for an idle game. I will rate this 5 stars, but I think there is always room for improvement. For the current cherry blossom event, I wish that I could plant my trees without the housing space limitations. It would be great if the game could offer more customization options by allowing players to design their island the way they like. Besides that it's a cute and nice game to play.",5,2020-05-09 10:03:19
Finished building the rocket launcher with paying 1 buck and watching tonnes of ads. Nice experience.,5,2020-05-09 10:01:13
"One star because After installation, this game opened in a 4×3 size instead of a full screen. The controls were taking input from full screen but the display was small. Idk whats wrong.

They love you more genuinely than people do,5,2020-05-07 10:24:24
I love the way this game is set up. It keeps me coming back to see how my penguins are doing. I love the way you implement gems and the other forms of cash and that you can actually get gems quite easily with ads and tasks. I just absolutely love what you've done with the animations as well. They're all so cute and creative. I would have never expected a balloon popping at the adventure park or a cotton candy maker penguin. This is one of the best relaxing games I've ever played.,5,2020-05-07 09:07:54

It was pretty good! Got a bit unbalanced at times where it would take weeks to unlock the next thing. Of course not being able to purchase penguins got annoying and the limits of penguins at the end got very glitchy. Very fun though and has a nice aesthetic.,4,2020-05-07 08:29:49

"Decoration Limit Is Terrible This would be 5 stars, but, Why the heck is there a limit of how many decorations you can have???? That is incredibly stupid, as decorations are the only way to customize your isle, and have no effect on gameplay, yet you are limited to a meager thirty. Ridiculous.

"This game is perfect, except for the fact that there are so many ads that it makes me feel like this game was made for ads to pop out but then again I'd do anything to look at penguins",4,2020-05-03 09:31:55

Nice game I love penguins. The music is nice to it's one of those game for early morning chill time,5,2020-05-02 22:48:12
The good penguin will be a good one for me and the water 💦 and the water will be a bit of a mess for me and I hope you will be able to make it for me as well ⚅ and the water will not be a worry of the water 💦 as we have a lot of other people have asked for a few weeks notice of us and we will 5.natasha the water will also be a good place to work for my family as they will not have any water or water or heating etc which 4455 5.natasha and the water will not melt again and the water will not be,5,2020-05-02 20:23:49
"Its a very relaxing game, The adds are nice because it can give you extra bonuses.",5,2020-05-02 20:00:48
"Love the game and its aesthetics. I have reached the maximum of the game a few weeks ago, may I know if there will be additional landmarks and upgrades coming soon?",5,2020-05-02 19:46:54
It's a good concept but the economy is terribly broken... your penguins dont earn nearly enough to progress you in the game and the only way to progress is to watch ads where your reward will be allot and I mean allot... its basically play until you have watched enough ads buy another section of land and continue... it's pretty stupid how it works you literally do nothing and it takes no effort... I played for like 30 minutes and already had several pieces of land and like level 70 penguins,2,2020-05-02 19:26:43

Love it ^^ so relaxing and makes me happy😁,5,2020-05-02 01:49:24
"It's rare to find a game that entirely fills the role as a ""time-waster"". And i have to say, it's a good one. It's relaxing to see a flock of penguins fooling around on your own paradise island, accompanied with slow and refreshing music.",5,2020-05-01 23:58:40

The game is absolutely amazing!!!,5,2020-05-01 17:40:52
A game where cuteness is to much,5,2020-05-01 16:59:02
It's a nice game with a good graphics. And a interesting music and facts. But if the you (developers) can add little bit online feature into offline so the gamers will can feel little more interest in playing.... Thanks for a wonderful game,4,2020-05-01 15:59:25
The grafics are great and the soothing voice 😍,5,2020-05-01 15:24:06
Absolutely love the game.. the only issue is the whale nest seems a little bit like animal cruelty.. I suggest that if you guys could make the whale leave sometimes and come back a few seconds after... apart from that amazing game.. would have given a five star but the whale in the whale nest saddens me... amazing game though 👏👏,4,2020-05-01 14:37:47
Well done.,4,2020-05-01 13:59:19
Good for ofline games,1,2020-05-01 13:08:19
"Really should reduce the ad requirement to progress in the game. Tasks to upgrade should not require watching treasure ship ads. C'mon now, that's pretty low. Would be a nice little relaxing game otherwise, just feels like a cash grab.",2,2020-05-01 12:46:50
Nice app but mine👉📱isn't because when I start playing the app would always lag how it lags is the game always make the screen go in the corner and I can't tap anything in the screen nice app though can you pls fix it 🙂😉😆thank you 😘😘❤️credits for the game 🎮💕,4,2020-05-01 12:30:45

Have to agree with others that at the start this was great but I've been going for soooo long now and can't get to the next level (whale level). This does need to change as its getting boring now.,4,2020-04-30 23:30:25

"Install this to test your patience. The exorbitant amount of gold required to build a new area (not initially but in later stages) will force you to take a route, either splurge money or patiently wait. Am going for second one as in game purchases are quite expensive except for the beginner (basic?) game pack which I bought as a token of appreciation for the work put into the game. Relaxing gameplay. Audio is just perfect and reminds me of stardew valley. It's going to be a long journey...",5,2020-04-30 11:11:41
So fun!!!!!,5,2020-04-30 10:27:52
"The game is a great game but there are a few problems. As soon as you get to the janitor and after, it becomes more and more difficult to make money without using gems 24/7. Another small problem that only I saw is that on the platform the janitor stands on, the broom doesn't hit the floor and neither do any penguins and it really bothers me😂. I love how cute the penguins are and I hope the devs keep updating the game to further increase the adorable experience.",4,2020-04-30 09:36:57

boring,3,2020-04-29 17:50:13
"Maybe it's just my phone, but zooming in and out is very slow and therefore frustrating. There doesn't seem to be any way to auto-collect happiness hearts, so to grind those I need to constantly be on the lookout for them, then make sure I don't misclick on the wrong icon (that thing in the center of the isle). Frustrating and not at all relaxing. Also the app constantly wants me to photograph my penguins. No thanks, I can just google cute penguin pics instead. I played for about ten minutes.",1,2020-04-29 17:35:22

"I really really love this game and have been playing non stop for a month or 2 now. Ive recently bought the fishing boat package and tbh i was a little disappointed. The decription says it gives an item every hour but does not desvribe to you what ""items"" are actually recievable from this. Now i know it only gives 1 penguin card every hour and it is a stationaty boat that does not move around the island. Imo you are basically just paying for the gems for this package and am disappointed.",4,2020-04-29 12:24:35
