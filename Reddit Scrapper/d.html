Anyone running their own node can see how many UTXOs exist at anytime by looking at the UTXO Set.\n\nHere's the incredible part:  there's only 68 million UTXOs.  68 million!  That means there are only a maximum of 68 million people who control the keys their bitcoin in a world of 7.5 billion!  But of course we know the real amount is much lower than that when considering most exchanges have thousands if not millions of UTXOs, all the lost bitcoins, HD wallets etc. \n\nWe absolutely must prioritize the removal of our coins from all exchanges as quickly as possible. These exchanges have been invested in heavily by the banks years ago and they have their tentacles in as deep as possible and have been manipulating the USD price of bitcoin for years. They do so using other methods that have controlled other hard asset prices for decades. These manipulation tactics combine rehypothification, commingling, cash settled futures, OTC markets, along with coordinating the denial of access to exchanges when they start to lose control of the process momentarily.\n\nLook, the banks are the competition to bitcoin. They run the world by creation of dollars which we all currently (directly or in directly) depend on as it is the world reserve currency. Every day we sell our labor and skills for dollars that they directly control the production and value of them. Meanwhile we live in a world where they have brainwashed people to believe that inflation by devaluing the currencies we sell ourselves for is a good thing!  Thank God we now have a viable exit strategy with bitcoin!  However the only way for the majority to pry the power away from the legacy financial system is to decide that we want to determine what the value of our time is rather than let them make us work longer and harder every year for less purchasing power.  \n\nAnd we can!  Well that is if we accept that supply and demand truly determines value, then we must hold our Bitcoin keys individually for it to be valued for what it truly is - the world's first truly finite asset with properties that are superior to all previous SOVs before it and one that can be carried around in your brain!\n\nThis can absolutely be our peaceful revolution!

My dad acknowledges the power of the tech and has some fascination with smart contract platforms like ETH.\n\nBut..He argues against buying BTC specifically. His theory is that BTC is fundamentally similar to gold from an economics stand point, yes, but there is nothing specifically special about BTC in the Crypto ecosystem other than the fact that it’s got the first mover advantage. Apparently, BTC is popular only because..it’s popular!\n\nGold is special in its use cases, as it plays a significant role in jewellery, manufacturing and areas that make it physically superior to other metals - But nothing actually makes BTC superior to other cryptocurrencies other than the large number of people that trust the network today. His view is that if BTC was replicated but with slightly better tech (for example, further decentralisation by making entry to mining easier/cheaper), the original BTC will lose in the long run. His view is that BTC is superior today but not tomorrow.\n\nHelp.</td>

      <td>It's absolutely incredible when you think about it. The fact that there are only 68 million UTXOs. That means that the theoretical maximum amount of people who have any Bitcoin is 68 million! Although we know that the number is much much lower than that. We know this because as an individual Bitcoin holder with a wallet you yourself have multiple UTXOs on average if you've ever sent any Bitcoin to more than one address or had anyone send you bitcoin to more than one address in the same wallet. \n\nJust think about how many UTXOs these exchanges must have!  We are so early still the upside is absolutely unfathomable when you think about what will happen when people actually learn what it is and start HODLing their own keys. That's when the real revolution will be in full effect and hyperbitcoinization can be a reality!</td>
