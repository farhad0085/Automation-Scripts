0,i19uta,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Sticky FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following videos for a good starting point for understanding how bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

* [Video 1: Introduction to Bitcoin - Andreas Antonopoulos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1si5ZWLgy0&amp;list=PLPQwGV1aLnTuN6kdNWlElfr2tzigB9Nnj&amp;index=2&amp;t=1s)
* [Video 2: The Trust Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKwqNgG-Sv4)
* [Video 3: Bitcoin 101 - Balaji Srinivasan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIxwTx7o_B4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=0s)

Some other great resources include [Lopp.net](http://lopp.net/bitcoin.html), the [Princeton crypto series](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7qynvj/dont_panic_just_learn_sixty_free_lectures_from/) and James D'Angelo's [Bitcoin 101 Blackboard series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhe61JaNFLU&amp;list=PLzctEq7iZD-7-DgJM604zsndMapn9ff6q&amp;index=7&amp;t=0s).  

Some excellent writing on Bitcoin's value proposition and future can be found at the [Satoshi Nakamoto Institute](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/).  

Some Bitcoin statistics can be found [here](https://data.bitcoinity.org/bitcoin/hashrate/6m?c=m&amp;g=15&amp;r=week&amp;t=a) and
 [here](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/).  Developer resources can be found [here](https://developer.bitcoin.org/).  Peer-reviewed research papers can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VaWhbAj7hWNdiE73P-W-wrl5a0WNgzjofmZXe0Rh5sg).  

Potential upcoming protocol improvements and scaling resources [here](http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/2018-01-24-rusty-russell-future-bitcoin-tech-directions/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/56nnd8/the_scaling_bitcoin_website_is_awesome_videos/).  

The number of times Bitcoin was declared dead by the media can be found [here](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be 21,000,000 bitcoins created and they are issued in a predictable fashion, you can view the inflation schedule [here](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The halving countdown can be found [here](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/).
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read the source code yourself [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin).
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://stadicus.github.io/RaspiBolt/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoins reside has the authority to move them.
* **Low fee scaling** - On chain transaction fees depend on network demand and how much priority you wish to assign to the transaction.  Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view current fees [here](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and mempool activity [here](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w).  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7pwna9/lightning_network_megathread/), a second layer scaling solution currently rolling out on the Bitcoin mainnet.  
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](http://bitcoinsimplified.org/learn-more/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Encrypted cryptographically and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible after one or more confirmations.  
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries with a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer).
* **Portable** - Bitcoins are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can even be transported by simply [memorizing a string of words](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) for wallet recovery (while cool this method is generally not recommended due to potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for new users due to ease of use and additional security).
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on [Layer 2 networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network) built on top of Bitcoin.
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin.
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat

## Where can I buy bitcoins?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular resources are below, also check out the [bitcoinity exchange resources](https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/exchanges/USD/30d) for a larger list of options for purchases.  

* [Cash app](https://cash.app/help/us/en-us/1016-bitcoin)
* [Gemini](https://gemini.com/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/)
* [BitFinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/)
* [Xapo](https://xapo.com/)
* [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/)
* [Cex](https://cex.io/cards/)
* [LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [P2P exchange list](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/) (decentralized) 

[Here](http://coinatmradar.com/) is a listing of local ATMs.  If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoins are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. [Preev](http://preev.com/btc/usd) is a useful site that  that shows how much various denominations of bitcoin are worth in different currencies. Alternatively you can just Google ""1 bitcoin in (your local currency)"".

## Securing your bitcoins

With bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoins **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold the bitcoins for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn computer security best practices, then a hardware wallet such as the [Trezor](https://www.bitcointrezor.com/), [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/) or [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) is recommended.  Alternatively there are many software wallet options to choose from [here](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) depending on your use case.

* If you prefer to let third party **""Bitcoin banks""** manage your coins, try [Gemini](https://gemini.com/) but be aware you may not be in control of your private keys in which case you would have to ask permission to access your funds and be exposed to third party risk.  

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.  

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth
--------------|--------|------------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&amp;hl=en) | N/A
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384)

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins (shitcoins) are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  Don't trust, verify.  Also as they say in our community ""Not your keys, not your coins"".  

## Where can I spend bitcoins?

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoins can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](http://folding.stanford.edu/).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read more [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions you can [run a full node](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/features/) using [this setup guide](https://blog.lopp.net/how-to-set-up-a-bitcoin-full-node/).  If you would prefer to keep it simple there are [several good options](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/buy-or-diy-an-overview-of-7-bitcoin-full-node-products).  You can view the global node distribution [here](https://getaddr.bitnodes.io/).

## Bitcoin Units

One Bitcoin is quite large (hundreds of £/$/€) so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in recent Electrum wallet releases
bit | bit | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin (μBTC)
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10000 for one Bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100k sats

For more information check out the [Bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

39,ja2hwt,"TL;DR Libya is a cash-only society, where every merchant only deals in cash. There is no electronic banking system of debit cards, credit cards, or Interac machines -- just cash. But the banks ran out of cash. So, people can't buy anything because they can't access their funds because, remember, banks ran out of cash. Bitcoin would seem to solve every problem. How do we get Bitcoin into Libya?

Hey everyone,

First of all, full disclosure, I know very little about Bitcoin, or cryptocurrency in general, so as I make this post, please forgive any ignorance.

As a Libyan, we're seeing numerous challenges in our banking system in Libya (which, in all fairness, is just one of, many other, larger political issues if you happen to have been following Middle Eastern/Libyan news for the last decade).

The Central Bank of Libya has not had cash for an exceedingly long period of time, post 2011, which is problematic because Libya is a cash-only society. Every transaction, be it a house, or a loaf of bread, has always ever been transacted in cash only. While people do have bank accounts, with your account balance merely printed on paper, there has never been debit or credit cards in Libya. The only way one can access their funds from their bank account is by physically going to the bank and withdrawing cash. This is still the case today and, as you might have imagined, people have already long flooded the banks, and have depleted them of their reserves.

Consequently, the majority of Libyans have no access to their money in their accounts, and have only been at the mercy of when banks re-supply their reserves. In an attempt at maximizing the opportunity at every Libyan getting \*some\* cash, of course the bank imposes a depressingly low withdraw limit per person, who are all waiting in line-ups that are literally days long. Naturally, the bank's small reserve is instantaneously depleted, again and again, and if you were not of the lucky few to retrieve cash, then you go home with your tail between your legs and hope for a better next time.

The obvious solution to this would have been for the ""government"" to simply deploy an electronic system wherein Libya catches up to 21st century's earth-shattering technology: debit and credit cards, and Interac machines! Needless to say, this has not been done, yet, and we can very strongly assume that the ""government"" has no interest in doing this. I will not get into politics, or conspiracy here, but much of it leans in that direction. (Note: I put ""government"" in quotes because what I really mean is Libya doesn't exactly have a government, and the decision-makers are, essentially, foreign intelligence via domestic militia groups).

With all of that said, enter Bitcoin and my questions to the problems I wish to ask and wonder if Bitcoin solves:

(1) The first problem we have, of course, is that people are limited to cash to purchase food. However, if every merchant simply accepted Bitcoin, people can simply pay with their phones, without the need for cash. Everybody, and their grandmother, has a smartphone or two. Am I missing something here, or am I correct with the ease of use?

(2) The second problem we have is that nobody in Libya can be transferred money, from outside of Libya, even if Libyans had international friends and family willing to help them with money. But, with Bitcoin, you can simply transfer funds online with relative ease. Am I correct here, as well?

(3) I have no idea whether or not Bitcoin is currently available in Libya; furthermore, I have no idea whether or not Bitcoin is legal in Libya (and, frankly, if the aforementioned problems can be solved, nobody will care about its ""legality""). So, can Bitcoin be adopted in Libya, with relative ease, without necessitating the banking system or government? Or would this undertaking be a major project?

If possible, I would be very interested in working with anyone who can help make this a reality in all of Libya. I'm willing to do what's needed to be done (within my capabilities, of course), be it aggressive marketing/advertising, or otherwise. Thoughts, suggestions, help!

43,jag76x,"I often post things here that really come across as fud, but what we have seen these last couple months is an explosion in regulator activity. The way the US federal government works, is it sits on cases for years at a time in secrecy, and then it attacks.

There are many obscure laws that people are all unaware of which entirely relate to the war on terror and 9/11 and the Patriot Act. The truth is that most of these banking laws that changed are a result of their pretense to behave like a police state under the guise of fighting terrorism. Well What does that have to do with bitcoin?

&amp;#x200B;

They want to set the precedence of those anti terrorism laws and banking laws onto end to end encryption and bitcoin. These people have a clear motive they are trying to keep hid, that crypto lawyer are beginning to speculate isn't off the table. They certainly implied in the DoJ 83 page report that those options are on the table. But the truth is, they \*already\* want to do it anyways.

Before I make the case for what I am alleging you need to know about the key regulatory bodies and some of these laws, which I'm just gonna list for you to research in case you doubt me:

1) OFAC 2)FATF 3)BIS 4)Interpol 5)Banking Secrecy Act 6)Treasury Department 7)Federal Reserve

Namely, What can the US do under OFAC in the guise of anti terrorism. Well the short answer is ANYTHING. And that is what this 83 page guide by Barr is claiming, that is what the Bitmex Indictment by the Department of Justice is claiming, that is what they have been doing in Afghanistan and Iraq for 20 years. It's been like this since 9/11 and now they are squaring in on crypto.

***It is clear that the Department of Justice and AG Barr do not want Bitcoin to function as Bitcoin, much like end to end encryption they want a back door***

But let's talk about what that ***looks*** like.

1) Forcing every country in the world to enforce mandatory KYC on all decentralized smart contracts and all centralized exchanges with the threat of extrajudicial indictment and OFAC black listing for Banking Secrecy Act violations and Terrorism funding.

2) Forcing every country to prohibit withdrawls to any non preregistered white listed address that has been vetted by CipherTrace and Chain Analysis with the threat as stated in 1)

3) Forcing every country to prohibit US customers from making an account without extremely profoundly high regulatory costs, thus trapping capital in the united states and prohibiting US citizen from investing overseas, as most modern Banks today will no longer take Americans as customers overseas, due to the same regulatory threats.

4) Forcing every merchant in America, and as many outside of America to use Chain Analysis and Cipher Trace on all transactions to vet the source of the funds, ***and if those funds do not have a chain of custody on a public blockchain linking back to a white listed kyced account, then rejecting those transactions (no more monero)***

5) Forcing every exchange in the world to do the same chain of custody verification on every customer just as above.

6) Disallowing any deposits in a US financial exchange to cash out without said chain of custody.

7) Disallowing any cash out of funds that have not been declared as owned assets in a perpetually pervasively monitored public address that the US regulatory bodies know about.

8) ***The constant threat of censorship and forced confiscation.***

9) ***The backdooring of all hardware wallets and software wallets, prosecution of developers. Indictments against Trezor and Ledgernano.***

10) ***Perpetual Surveilance***

Hello all, this is my first post on this subreddit. I will try to be informative and brief. 

7 of the worlds' central banks released a report on Friday, outlining their findings on CBDC (central bank digital currencies). In the 26 page document, neither Bitcoin nor any existing digital currency was mentioned once. The fundamental qualities that make bitcoin valuable stand in direct conflict with the desires a central bank would have in creating a digital currency (namely, to control the money supply).

78,ja8q87,"I’m trying to deepen my understanding of exactly how this system works and learn the critical path of operations as well as correct terminology for the system. My main question is as follows:

So because any bitcoin wallet (hot or cold) can generate as many addresses as the user desires I am wondering where exactly all those addresses lead? Since all these different addresses (generated by the same user from the same wallet in this example) bring received btc to the same place, where it’s compiled, is this “place” technically called a “ledger account”? 

If so then can wallets (hot and cold) essentially be considered the keeper of any given ledger account’s private keys as well the mechanism in which the ledger account is updated (when bitcoin is either sent or received from that ledger account)?",Bitcoin blockchain nomenclature,qualitycannabisnw,2,0,2020-10-13 13:29:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ja8q87/bitcoin_blockchain_nomenclature/,4
