0,i19uta,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Sticky FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following videos for a good starting point for understanding how bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

* [Video 1: Introduction to Bitcoin - Andreas Antonopoulos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1si5ZWLgy0&amp;list=PLPQwGV1aLnTuN6kdNWlElfr2tzigB9Nnj&amp;index=2&amp;t=1s)
* [Video 2: The Trust Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKwqNgG-Sv4)
* [Video 3: Bitcoin 101 - Balaji Srinivasan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIxwTx7o_B4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=0s)

Some other great resources include [Lopp.net](http://lopp.net/bitcoin.html), the [Princeton crypto series](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7qynvj/dont_panic_just_learn_sixty_free_lectures_from/) and James D'Angelo's [Bitcoin 101 Blackboard series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhe61JaNFLU&amp;list=PLzctEq7iZD-7-DgJM604zsndMapn9ff6q&amp;index=7&amp;t=0s).  

Some excellent writing on Bitcoin's value proposition and future can be found at the [Satoshi Nakamoto Institute](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/).  

Some Bitcoin statistics can be found [here](https://data.bitcoinity.org/bitcoin/hashrate/6m?c=m&amp;g=15&amp;r=week&amp;t=a) and
 [here](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/).  Developer resources can be found [here](https://developer.bitcoin.org/).  Peer-reviewed research papers can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VaWhbAj7hWNdiE73P-W-wrl5a0WNgzjofmZXe0Rh5sg).  

Potential upcoming protocol improvements and scaling resources [here](http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/2018-01-24-rusty-russell-future-bitcoin-tech-directions/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/56nnd8/the_scaling_bitcoin_website_is_awesome_videos/).  

The number of times Bitcoin was declared dead by the media can be found [here](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be 21,000,000 bitcoins created and they are issued in a predictable fashion, you can view the inflation schedule [here](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The halving countdown can be found [here](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/).
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read the source code yourself [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin).
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://stadicus.github.io/RaspiBolt/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoins reside has the authority to move them.
* **Low fee scaling** - On chain transaction fees depend on network demand and how much priority you wish to assign to the transaction.  Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view current fees [here](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and mempool activity [here](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w).  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7pwna9/lightning_network_megathread/), a second layer scaling solution currently rolling out on the Bitcoin mainnet.  
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](http://bitcoinsimplified.org/learn-more/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Encrypted cryptographically and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible after one or more confirmations.  
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries with a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer).
* **Portable** - Bitcoins are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can even be transported by simply [memorizing a string of words](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) for wallet recovery (while cool this method is generally not recommended due to potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for new users due to ease of use and additional security).
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on [Layer 2 networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network) built on top of Bitcoin.
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin.
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat

## Where can I buy bitcoins?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular resources are below, also check out the [bitcoinity exchange resources](https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/exchanges/USD/30d) for a larger list of options for purchases.  

* [Cash app](https://cash.app/help/us/en-us/1016-bitcoin)
* [Gemini](https://gemini.com/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/)
* [BitFinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/)
* [Xapo](https://xapo.com/)
* [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/)
* [Cex](https://cex.io/cards/)
* [LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [P2P exchange list](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/) (decentralized) 

[Here](http://coinatmradar.com/) is a listing of local ATMs.  If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoins are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. [Preev](http://preev.com/btc/usd) is a useful site that  that shows how much various denominations of bitcoin are worth in different currencies. Alternatively you can just Google ""1 bitcoin in (your local currency)"".

## Securing your bitcoins

With bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoins **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold the bitcoins for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn computer security best practices, then a hardware wallet such as the [Trezor](https://www.bitcointrezor.com/), [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/) or [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) is recommended.  Alternatively there are many software wallet options to choose from [here](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) depending on your use case.

* If you prefer to let third party **""Bitcoin banks""** manage your coins, try [Gemini](https://gemini.com/) but be aware you may not be in control of your private keys in which case you would have to ask permission to access your funds and be exposed to third party risk.  

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.  

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth
--------------|--------|------------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&amp;hl=en) | N/A
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384)

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins (shitcoins) are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  Don't trust, verify.  Also as they say in our community ""Not your keys, not your coins"".

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoins can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](http://folding.stanford.edu/).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read more [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions you can [run a full node](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/features/) using [this setup guide](https://blog.lopp.net/how-to-set-up-a-bitcoin-full-node/).  If you would prefer to keep it simple there are [several good options](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/buy-or-diy-an-overview-of-7-bitcoin-full-node-products).  You can view the global node distribution [here](https://getaddr.bitnodes.io/).

## Bitcoin Units

One Bitcoin is quite large (hundreds of £/$/€) so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in recent Electrum wallet releases
bit | bit | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin (μBTC)
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10000 for one Bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100k sats

For more information check out the [Bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

13,ja2hwt,"TL;DR Libya is a cash-only society, where every merchant only deals in cash. There is no electronic banking system of debit cards, credit cards, or Interac machines -- just cash. But the banks ran out of cash. So, people can't buy anything because they can't access their funds because, remember, banks ran out of cash. Bitcoin would seem to solve every problem. How do we get Bitcoin into Libya?

Hey everyone,

First of all, full disclosure, I know very little about Bitcoin, or cryptocurrency in general, so as I make this post, please forgive any ignorance.

As a Libyan, we're seeing numerous challenges in our banking system in Libya (which, in all fairness, is just one of, many other, larger political issues if you happen to have been following Middle Eastern/Libyan news for the last decade).

The Central Bank of Libya has not had cash for an exceedingly long period of time, post 2011, which is problematic because Libya is a cash-only society. Every transaction, be it a house, or a loaf of bread, has always ever been transacted in cash only. While people do have bank accounts, with your account balance merely printed on paper, there has never been debit or credit cards in Libya. The only way one can access their funds from their bank account is by physically going to the bank and withdrawing cash. This is still the case today and, as you might have imagined, people have already long flooded the banks, and have depleted them of their reserves.

Consequently, the majority of Libyans have no access to their money in their accounts, and have only been at the mercy of when banks re-supply their reserves. In an attempt at maximizing the opportunity at every Libyan getting \*some\* cash, of course the bank imposes a depressingly low withdraw limit per person, who are all waiting in line-ups that are literally days long. Naturally, the bank's small reserve is instantaneously depleted, again and again, and if you were not of the lucky few to retrieve cash, then you go home with your tail between your legs and hope for a better next time.

The obvious solution to this would have been for the ""government"" to simply deploy an electronic system wherein Libya catches up to 21st century's earth-shattering technology: debit and credit cards, and Interac machines! Needless to say, this has not been done, yet, and we can very strongly assume that the ""government"" has no interest in doing this. I will not get into politics, or conspiracy here, but much of it leans in that direction. (Note: I put ""government"" in quotes because what I really mean is Libya doesn't exactly have a government, and the decision-makers are, essentially, foreign intelligence via domestic militia groups).

With all of that said, enter Bitcoin and my questions to the problems I wish to ask and wonder if Bitcoin solves:

(1) The first problem we have, of course, is that people are limited to cash to purchase food. However, if every merchant simply accepted Bitcoin, people can simply pay with their phones, without the need for cash. Everybody, and their grandmother, has a smartphone or two. Am I missing something here, or am I correct with the ease of use?

(2) The second problem we have is that nobody in Libya can be transferred money, from outside of Libya, even if Libyans had international friends and family willing to help them with money. But, with Bitcoin, you can simply transfer funds online with relative ease. Am I correct here, as well?

(3) I have no idea whether or not Bitcoin is currently available in Libya; furthermore, I have no idea whether or not Bitcoin is legal in Libya (and, frankly, if the aforementioned problems can be solved, nobody will care about its ""legality""). So, can Bitcoin be adopted in Libya, with relative ease, without necessitating the banking system or government? Or would this undertaking be a major project?

If possible, I would be very interested in working with anyone who can help make this a reality in all of Libya. I'm willing to do what's needed to be done (within my capabilities, of course), be it aggressive marketing/advertising, or otherwise. Thoughts, suggestions, help!

Hello all, this is my first post on this subreddit. I will try to be informative and brief. 

7 of the worlds' central banks released a report on Friday, outlining their findings on CBDC (central bank digital currencies). In the 26 page document, neither Bitcoin nor any existing digital currency was mentioned once. The fundamental qualities that make bitcoin valuable stand in direct conflict with the desires a central bank would have in creating a digital currency (namely, to control the money supply). Therefore, why on earth are central banks considering the issuance of their own currencies? It is because they are finally seeing bitcoin as a direct threat to their power.",Central Banks are scared,mulebotte,35,0,2020-10-13 03:42:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ja09tj/central_banks_are_scared/,12
25,ja6x5m,"I don't have any bitcoin at the moment, but I'm interested in buying some. My buddy has bitcoin on robinhood and he said I can buy some too. I watched some YouTube video about buying a wallet so I went online at blockchain website and opened me a wallet. I also made an account on coinbase. My buddy said bitcoin is anonymous so the government can't find out if you own any. Now the questions are (my buddy couldn't answer them)

1. If I buy bitcoin on coinbase website, how is it anonymous? I literally had to provide my SSN and verify my identity. Doesn't that mean coinbase know it belongs to me? And if the government wanted to know if I have any bitcoin they can just ask coinbase? 

2. If transfer my bitcoin to a hardware wallet (my buddy told me about ledger website where I can buy me a flash drive wallet thing) won't there be traces of where the bitcoin came from and the person identity? Like if I transfer my bitcoin from coinbase to my hardware wallet there will be traces of the transfer right? Like banks? Or is this part anonymous? I know coinbase or the government isn't that dumb. If I transfer my bitcoin to a hardware wallet they know it was transfer from coinbase to a different wallet that presumably belongs to me..?

So because any bitcoin wallet (hot or cold) can generate as many addresses as the user desires I am wondering where exactly all those addresses lead? Since all these different addresses (generated by the same user from the same wallet in this example) bring received btc to the same place, where it’s compiled, is this “place” technically called a “ledger account”? 

If so then can wallets (hot and cold) essentially be considered the keeper of any given ledger account’s private keys as well the mechanism in which the ledger account is updated (when bitcoin is either sent or received from that ledger account)?",Bitcoin blockchain nomenclature,qualitycannabisnw,5,0,2020-10-13 13:29:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ja8q87/bitcoin_blockchain_nomenclature/,4

66,j9zy6k,"I've created a transaction validation program to sanity check btc transactions before and after signing (and before broadcasting). Below is the description of the overall protocol for doing a btc withdrawal from a wallet. The program does validation for steps #2 and #4.  Step #2 is designed to validate that Electrum is not compromised and is not generating malicious transactions. #Step 4 is designed to validate that the HW wallet is not compromised and is not generating malicious transactions.

Part of what it does is to identify whether addresses involved in the transactions are yours or not yours, and whether they are receive or change addresses, based on a set of named xpub keys that you put into a local config file, to prevent change address attacks and other attacks, and to just ensure you didn't accidentally choose the wrong address.

The program does not touch any private keys, only hd wallet master pub keys (xpub, zpub)

Trust minimized withdrawal protocol:

\#1. Generate candidate transaction in Electrum watch-only wallet, save as PSBT.

**#2. Validator, unsigned tx. - load PSBT into Validator. Verify Tx details (inputs, outputs, addresses, fee, amounts). Identify wallet ownership of any addresses involved in the tx (e.g. to validate that the change address actually belongs to your wallet). Display sha256 of PSBT File contents. If all looks good, Validator will copy the PSBT to the SD for signing. This step protects against a compromised version of Electrum generating a malicious transaction, and ensures only validated transactions come in contact with signing device.**

\#3. HW wallet. Verify sha256 hashes of PSBT file from Validator and as generated on HW device to ensure this PSBT is the same as the PSBT validated in step #2. Verify tx details. If good, sign PSBT.  Take note of signed tx file sha256 hash.

**#4. Validator, signed tx. Verify signed tx file sha256 hash matches HW device to ensure data integrity in transit. Re-verify tx details (inputs, outputs, addresses, fee, amounts), to protect against a compromised HW wallet firmware generating malicious transactions. If validation looks ok, Validator will send tx bytes to full node for broadcasting.**

71,ja6rui,"Micheal Cohen stands as the Vice President of Global Operations at MyChargeBack, a consumer protection company. Cohen had given comment in regard to how fraudsters are taking advantage of crypto transactions, particularly their irreversible nature.

At its first envisioning, one of the key selling points of Bitcoin was how it would protect retailers even more than credit cards could. Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic founder of Bitcoin, gave a comeback to an early adopter’s complaint on an email on the 10th of October, 2008. The adopter, James A. Donald, complained that Bitcoin transactions weren’t instantaneously final.

Its Greatest Strength Being Turned To Weakness

In response, Satoshi highlighted the fact that paper checks can bounce following one or two weeks, with credit card transactions being capable of being contested for up to 60 to even 180 days after the fact. Bitcoin, Satoshi points out, is irreversible enough only after a few hours.

Cohen highlighted that, in some cases, a chargeback for credit cards are possible a full 18 months after the transaction was made. He further highlighted the two types of classification of credit card chargebacks: Unauthorized Use, and Authorized Use. Unauthorized, for example, is when a criminal illegally gains access to one’s credit card. Authorized, in turn, means when the cardholder themselves authorized the transaction, but they’re not satisfied with the outcome.


Cohen highlighted how, when it comes to crypto, consumers are only capable of recovering funds, should it be an unauthorized transaction. This is due to how credit companies, such as Visa or MasterCard, explicitly exclude certain industries from the authorized use category, such as gambling or crypto.

Crypto Scammers Are Like Grass In A Field

Much to Cohen’s dismay, he highlighted how crypto serves as such a convenient tool for scammers to collect funds, which are subsequently harming the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies. Cohen put it simply, highlighting that these people that got scammed through the use of crypto fraudsters, won’t be the ones that will promote the usage of cryptocurrency to others.

One of the most used tactics for these fraudsters, according to Cohen, is the offering of various services and products, typically related to forex trading. This is generally offered to an unsuspecting customer. At the last moment, the scammer eventually convinces the unsuspecting victim to pay for the service, or otherwise fund their new account by way of crypto.

Some Sliver Of Hope

Luckily for these victims, Cohen highlighted how not all hope should be lost. His company helps victims by identifying scammers, doing so by way of tracking the money movement in the blockchain. Typically, criminals opt to move to an exchange to cash out their crypto, and Cohen highlighted that many exchanges are quite eager to stamp these criminals out.",MyChargeBack Says Fraudsters Are Moving To Bitcoin From Credit Cards,cryptoanalyticatech,0,0,2020-10-13 10:46:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ja6rui/mychargeback_says_fraudsters_are_moving_to/,4

""What if this whole process were automated with cryoptographically-enforced trust, \[...\]. If the flight is on time, the smart contract pays itself.""

How will ""cryptographically-enforced trust"" be any different from what we currently have? Is not this problem more about to be able to automatically identify that in fact a flight delay occurred, rather than being able to trust that it occurred? I mean, if the flight is delayed, that is an undeniable fact that it is possible to handle with non-blockchain technology.

How would you see this problem being solved with blockchain?
