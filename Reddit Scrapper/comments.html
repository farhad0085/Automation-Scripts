There are no trading hours. \n\nWhen you obtain a bitcoin (through work, gifting, exchanging it for fiat currency, etc.) it now becomes subject to these market fluctuations no matter where it is stored. \n\nLook at it similarly to owning a bar of gold. If you purchase a bar of gold, it's value in exchange for dollars will always change, even if you have it stored away in a safe vault. The same applies to bitcoin.</td>

Prior to drops, there always seems to be 5+ pieces of doom and gloom speculation, potentially influencing panicky new hobby investors or newcomers like myself potentially. I know drops and corrections come with the territory. I also know Robinhood is not the preferred platform in any way here, and entails only speculation and not ownership. Probably attributing pattern and meaning to coincidence in retrospect? Thanks for all the posts and info and laughs, looking forward to continuing to learn!</td>

My question is if i quit right now do i get taxes on my short-live $600 or at the end of the year, because my total net gain is $100. I only have to pay taxes on that $100. Thanks</td>

Would be surprising if this were the case with any wallet, so you shouldn't have any problems with that.  \n\nTo avoid such type of issues I would recommend to always use a "proper" wallet (recommendations you can find here: https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/recommended-wallets.html)</td>

Bitcoin is about trust minimization, and stepping up and proclaim "trust me" is the opposite of that, and implies authority, trust and simply would look scammy, tbh.  \n\nAlso, no human made software is guaranteed to be free from bugs, so if someone would claim something like above, they would imply they know that there are no bugs, no issues etc, which is simply not something anyone can claim (or would want to), because there are no 100% certainties.  \n\n&amp;gt;  i do front end graphics etc. dont hate lol.  \n\nWhy would I hate? :) Artist and front end graphic designers is a valuable and awesome job :)</td>

However, the card network and processing fees for Visa/Mastercard take up the majority of our fee. We're working on lowering them with scale, but that will take time. \n\nFor online exchanges you need Social Security Number even for a $1 purchase so consumers like our tiered approach on required information.

Can easily change how often you vape to make the transitions more comfortable. If you get headaches, you're probably getting too much nicotine--it's really easy with vape to overdo it.\n\nAlso, buy a hardware wallet to store your btc.</td>

No, it won't get you as blasted out of your mind like "recreational/medicinal" cannabis, but you'll still get surprisingly high for a substance that's legal in all 50 states, and you'll be *way, way* more relaxed than you would be with cigarettes.

I decided it wasn't worth risking my precious cpu. A few weeks later, I decided, screw it. When I get a new laptop I'd throw out the old cpu anyway. Maybe the bitcoins will be worth something some day. By then BTC had risen to 10 cents. I thought people were crazy spending 10 cents on funny money and that was the last I looked into it until I saw it on the darknet while browsing silk road out of mere curiosity.

      <td>Bitcoin does have privacy features, but I disagree with "privacy over everything else". An auditable supply is more important than privacy IMO. Not to say privacy isn't also important, but there are fundamental tradeoffs that can't be ignored. For example, if bitcoin became maximally private, but could be secretly inflated by unknown actors, that would be incredibly bad. There is the potential for this to happen in systems like Monero and Mimblewimble. You can't easily audit the supply of currency in those systems. I'm a big fan of both of those for privacy purposes, but you can't ignore the tradeoffs. \n\nBitcoin was the first currency to have a supply that's easily auditable by everyone, and the first with a verifiably limited supply. This is incredibly important - more important I think than privacy. Its existence means that people have a way to opt out of a system that steals all the excess wealth from the people and transfers it into the hands of corrupt bankers. \n\nIts incredibly unlikely that Bitcoin will be outlawed in first world countries. And in non-first-world countries there are many ways to retain privacy using bitcoin. The lightning network is likely to be the primary mechanism for most people using bitcoin in 10 years, and it'll likely be basically impossible to track payments with it, since its similar to the Tor network but will have a LOT more participants.</td>

If its not what he meant, he shouldn't have said it that way. Andreas has had a tendency to use misleading hyperbole at times. \n\n&amp;gt; Can you elaborate on what is that fundamental tradeoff between fungibility through privacy and auditability of supply that you allude to?\n\n[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/8erg8e/what_should_monero_do_about_the_soundness_problem/) has more info. \n\n&amp;gt; Was it clearly and unequivocally proven that both cannot be achieved?\n\nMy understanding is that yes it has. Greg Maxwell [mentions this fundamental tradeoff here](http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/gmaxwell-confidential-transactions/). \n\nThinking about it logically, if you don't know how much any transaction is transacting, then there is nothing to count up to verify the total supply, and thus no way of ensuring that transactions that inflate the supply are blocked. And conversely, if you have unconditional soundness, you must have a way to verify the supply, which fundamentally requires counting up the amounts from each transaction, which in turn removes privacy from those amounts.</td>

So as much as I try to be open minded, I still don't see how the supply auditability fundamentalism justifies itself.\n\nAs for Gregg Maxwell's post, it seems to me even himself didn't intend it to be 'the proof' when he stipulates that "if all this crap makes sense.."

      <td>&amp;gt; if the cryptography is broken, it's already bad enough aside from the inflated supply\n\nThose arguments are pretty poor IMO. The idea of those arguments is that if some crypto is broken, then everything collapses. However that is never what happens. When crypto is broken, its just like any other software bug: its patched and fixed and life goes on. The question is, what are the consequences? Was just a few individuals affected? Or are all users affected? That's the difference. \n\nIf you can verify the supply, no amount of broken cryptography can result in inflating the supply (and stealing wealth from every user of the currency), because any block that increases the supply would be rejected by every full node. By contrast, if the supply can be inflated without people knowing about it, the attacker could go for *years* or even *decades* inflating the supply without anyone knowing about it. That would be not only catastrophic for the currency when the hack is discovered, but it would represent the theft of potentially billions or trillions of dollars of wealth. That simply can't happen with bitcoin because its unconditionally sound.</td>

As I said to the parent commentator; you're thinking too small. 20% might just be the beginning. Maybe the next round will be 100%. Maybe more.\n\nWhy would they stop at 20%? As far as they are concerned they've got away with it scott free. Why not try again? And why limit to 20%?\n\nYou're assuming that everything will remain constant.

I'm not sure how big these things are, but they have taken over a large chunk of traditional video games, and I see a lot of 'non-gamer' people like my mother playing these free to play games, and spending way too much time on their phones doing other things, so maybe the share of the economy devoted to this type of spending or non-spending could be much bigger than I realize, and driving things like inflation levels.</td>

If it goes up enough that people actually want to spend it on coffee, the fees will be too high to even set up a lightning wallet. Since the fee is denominated in Bitcoin, at $1 million a Bitcoin, the fee for BOTH channel open and close would be $70, if fees were rock bottom 1 sat/byte, and they probably won't be. The only way I would ever pay that would be to send it to an exchange, and then ill peel off a few K to fiat every so often for spending.

With Lightning your transaction fees are denominated in millisatoshis.\n\nTransactions at $1M can be much cheaper than credit card purchases today.\n\nAs for setting up channels, Lightning does not need to have the BTC block chain as the back end. It can have Liquid BTC as their back end and it does not have the same problem with block size and transaction pressure as BTC. There can be many Liquid block chains and they can be replaced over time. Meaning, there could be 1000 Liquid BTC chains and they could have 100MB blocks without problem because they can be replaced every 100 years with perfect unbroken record keeping on the BTC block chain.\n\nBut that is not as safe as BTC on-chain transactions you say.

As Bitcoin and Lightning 1.0 are today, that wouldn't work, because the coins are too distributed to be easily seized, and people are less trusting, but if most of the day to day Bitcoin were locked in federated side chains like Liquid, it would be much more possible to take it all on one fell swoop, and go back to fiat, when some new war/pandemic happens, and the treasury is empty of BTC to deal with it...</td>

They are not solutions to the problem but it makes attacking the side chains less attractive.\n\n1.\tThe federation could be world wide such that one government alone couldn‚Äôt do it. Of course the reach of US Carriers are far reaching but at least confiscating Liquid BTC would be harder than writing a law to confiscate gold. You might have to threaten China, India, Russia and Japan to be able to do it. Still possible but far more problematic.\n2.\tThe way I see it Lightning and Liquid would only have spending money. My life‚Äôs savings would be on the chain so seizin Liquid and Lightning would be a substantial amount of money but a much smaller portion than my life‚Äôs savings.\n\nBut remember, with [Taproot and Channel factories](https://blockonomi.com/channel-factories-bitcoin-lightning-network/) we can open a Lightning channel with only about 10 bytes per channel. My simple math is that we can save up to 96% space while using Taproot and Channel factories. 96% * 250 bytes = 10 bytes.\n\nThat means that we can already open channels very efficiently.\n\nOne block is about 2.1MB in size, that means that we can open up to 210K Lightning channels per block. With 144 blocks per day we can open up to 30M channels per day. I feel my math is off somewhere. I feel the answer should be 2.8M channels per day. But either way, it is a rather large number of channels. The population of the US Could be on boarded in 10 days or 100 days depending on which of my numbers that are correct. That is probably faster than the banking system could do it if it had to start from 0 customers.</td>

Its likely both of these 'mystery fees' are percentage based, and thus would be quite high for anyone with some savings. Also you can't ever hold your own keys. Contrast this with a Checkbook IRA. You pay a flat annual fee $300-$1000, a 0.5 % fee to trade, and you can hold your own keys. \n\nYes, the initial fees are fairly high in dollars, but they drop as the account gets larger, and anyone with a decent sized retirement account would pay very little on a percentage basis, if bitcoin mooned, and that is what we are here for. I would hate myself if I were locked into something like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which has like a 100 % premium to the coins in it, and a 2 % annual fee. You need a LOT of mooning to cover such a huge annual fee...\n\nWhich version is better for you depends on your bag's size, but the point remains, its hard, fees are high wherever you go, and it just sucks compared to having mutual funds or stocks in an IRA.</td>

The software also supports various testing chains, and initially (if you run the software after merging) you will be able to use Schnorr, but only on those testing chains that are not intended to have monetary value (so they almost don't). I don't know what else to explain, you're gonna have to write some more detailed questions, and I would be happy to enlighten you.\n\nEDIT: To me, it makes sense to have the feature freeze for the most important features, those are the ones that affect the main chain. If something breaks for a testing chain, it doesn't have a large impact.</td>

Eventually it will, of course, but that's trivial: if it happens 400 years in the future, that's of no interest to you.\n\nThe largest differences between countries like Venezuela, etc, that you listed are:\n\n- The US debt is denominated in its own currency (other countries with hyperinflation have debt denominated in foreign currencies), and\n\n- The US monetary policy is set by (quasi independent) central bankers, not politicians, and\n\n- The world still largely believes the US can continue to service its debts.\n\nThese differences are the reasons the USD still retains value.  Unless these change, the value of the USD will remain relatively stable.\n\nFor long term stock investing, the best vehicles are low cost index funds.  Check out Jack Bogle's shorter books.  If you have an S&amp;amp;P fund and a total international index fund, lowest cost you can find, you're good.  Just get a tax advantaged account and let those ride.  Those two plus Bitcoin is not a bad long term play at all.\n\nSince you live in europe, consider the DAX or other market in addition, or whatever your country's main market is.</td>

      <td>The way I see it:\n1) If inflation is inevitably caused with fiat currency then the "world powers" are the best at prolonging the inevitable collapse. Nevertheless, one day it will happen or we will overhaul our system (cough cough cryptocurrency).\n2) Since I was a child I have personally noticed how everything has gotten more expensive and the cost of living is SIGNIFICANTLY higher. If printing more money is directly linked to inflation, we just hit the turbo button while we are traveling toward rock bottom. We printed 22% of all of the USD in existence in this one year alone. Let that sink in. Now if you remember how much inflation has effected your life since childhood like I do and printing money is directly related to inflation, we may have just boosted inflation 5-7 years into the future (basing this off of my lifetime and I am in the ballpark of 30 years old). That scares the shit out of me considering the snowball effect inflation has, not to mention how much I have already seen the effect throughout my life.\n3) We probably aren't even done printing money because of this pandemic, we may not even be close to being done.\n\nThis is why investing and believing in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is an absolute must for me. Way too many signs are funneling towards cryptocurrency being the only logical solution. I don't know about you, but I am getting exhausted by the lifestyle of working a 9-5 just to chip away at lifelong debt. We need a renewed purpose to life and that starts by breaking some of the chains holding us back. This is my insurance policy, not my gambling strategy.</td>

      <td>&amp;gt;  i was wondering if there is a guarantee that the US Dollar will collapse in value?\n\nThere is a guarantee that the dollar will depreciate over time. Its almost guaranteed to depreciate at least by 6%/year (which has been the long term monetary inflation rate up until 2008). \n\n&amp;gt; printing more USD doesn't automatically mean there will be high numbers of inflation (or perhaps hyperinflation)?\n\nIt actually does - eventually. Inflating the monetary base now may not cause price inflation now, and we might not see most of that price inflation for years because the velocity of money may continue to decrease. But there is no question the velocity of money will not decrease forever, and will very likely increase back to around 1.5 like it stayed at for decades. When it does, we will feel that inflation hard. \n\n&amp;gt; What is the difference in regards to the recent tragic events in Turkey, Libanon, Argentine, Venezuela, etc.?\n\nTheir governments are poorer and more volatile. They're also more corrupt. Those governments can simply hyperinflate their currency with little negative consequences to the government leadership. In the US, massive inflation would become a huge factor in elections that would cost a lot of politicians their jobs. So there is some additional political pressures that prevent the dollar from hyperinflating to quite the same degree. \n\n&amp;gt; Do you guys believe the Euro and Dollar one day will completely disappear?\n\nAll currencies disappear eventually.\n\n&amp;gt; If they go to a digital Euro/Dollar .. How will that be different from the cash we are using right now?\n\nVery little would be different from how people currently use fiat currencies digitally.</td>

I'll tell you what I learned though. You don't get flagged for a single cash deposit north of 10k its cash deposits that amount to more than 10k within a single month or at least that was my experience. I guess I did fuck up though I exceeded that limit in question with my second deposit the day after the first... Had I known that I would have still done it the way I did or else face the possibility of a structuring inquisition.</td>

      <td>It is easy to prove you own cryptocurrency. You simply need to sign a challenge message with the private keys for addresses in your wallet. The difficulty is that the embassy may not know how to verify your proof. \n\nHere's how it would be done if they did know (maybe you can show thm hwo). For example, if 10 of your addresses have coins adding up to $60k, ask the authority to give you a challenge message (they could send you something like "awe8732rfnh" or "This is the US Embassy's challenge message to you."). Then, you would sign that message with a number of your addresses. [Here's how to do that with Electrum](https://medium.com/@bytether/how-to-sign-a-message-with-a-electrum-wallet-121f45f0bb40). Then give the signatures to the authority and the bitcoin addresses you used to sign the message. They can then do the same process to verify your messages. By adding up the bitcoin in those addresses, they can verify how much coins you own in those addresses.\n\nI don't know if they will understand this method well enough to accept it. You could try teaching it to them, but it'll obviously be up to them as to whether they'll accept that as proof. I would simply ask what methods they accept as proof. They'll probably have a list.</td>

This is a private company and to have an account, an email verification is completely possible.\n\nBut keep in mind that bitcoin is an opt in system that requires no companies to mediate between you and your funds. If you are unsure of what I mean then you will be well served to get your head around self custody of your bitcoin. i.e. generate you own private/public key pair and take REAL posession of your coins.\n\nSimplest is to use [www.bitaddress.org](https://www.bitaddress.org). But learning how to use this site safely is important. Most people today use HW wallets to have high self custody security while also keeping your bitcoin near at hand if you want to use it.\n\nGood luck on your journey - it will proove to be the most important in your life.</td>

      <td>Hey all, I'm in a bit of a conundrum. The guide here [https://stadicus.github.io/RaspiBolt/raspibolt\_40\_lnd.html](https://stadicus.github.io/RaspiBolt/raspibolt_40_lnd.html) explains how to install lightning from its signed releases. The official docs [https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md) only describes how to build and install from source.\n\nWhat do people recommend? One has the benefit of being signed, and allows me to not install go. The other is "from source", but requires installation of go.\n\nI'd naturally assume that releases are more stable than building from source (master branch), but maybe there is a reason that they don't document how to install releases.</td>

But some guy, in some business, believed in it and eventually it took off.\n\nWhy did it take off? Because its a good idea, and good ideas + convenience = success.\n\n\nIt however, DIDNT work with people buying NFC phones then "Demanding it", it clearly worked the other way.\n\nSame with CDs, Cassette Tapes, Mp3s, Bluray etc. It almost always comes top down.

      <td>A reasonable modern conservative estimate for the number of atoms in the universe is 10^(78).  There are 2^(160) bitcoin addresses, or about 1.46x10^(48).  So we can conclude there are about 10^(30) times more atoms in the observable universe than there are bitcoin addresses.\n\nA more reasonable analogy is that there are about as many bitcoin addresses as there are atoms in the Earth (\~10^(49), give or take an order of magnitude).\n\nI'm bored and it's Sunday so I'll go a step further and say that as of December 2018 460 million (4.60x10^(8)) BTC addresses had been used at least once.  This about the same number of water molecules (again, give or take an order of magnitude) in one femoliter (10^(-15)) of water, which is about 1% the volume of a single red blood cell.  So you looking for a Bitcoin wallet would be like searching for that tiny volume spread over the entire Earth.</td>

You can start bitcoin core by running `bitcoind &amp;amp; disown`. Bitcoin core will startup and read the configurations in your `bitcoin.conf` file. Test that it is running by checking the log `tail -f ~/.bitcoin/debug.log` or with `bitcoin-cli uptime` (tells you for how many seconds bitcoin core has been running). `bitcoin-cli help` will give you a list of commands. To stop it, run `bitcoin-cli stop`. If you want testnet instead, just add the `-testnet` option (`bitcoind -testnet ...` and `bitcoin-cli -testnet ...`)\n\n\nIf you need help with anything, feel free to send me a PM here or on twitter (@pedr0fr).</td>

      <td>Great quote.  It identifies the psychological requirement for a free society.  Most people today are deeply afraid of responsibility.  Responsibility includes making decisions for oneself.  One must identify and choose one's values, career, place of residence, etc.\n\nFor the majority today, this strikes fear: One's job is not guaranteed, learning new skills for employment is challenging, planning and making provisions for emergencies and periods of illness is uncertain, etc.  At the root of this fear is a mistrust of one's self-efficacy, which can be further traced to bad philosophy that has accepted Immanuel Kant's tricky, but false, argument against self-efficacy and has permeated across all of our culture.  But I digress.\n\nThis majority fear of responsibility seeds the corruption of the concept of individual rights.  The concept of individual rights emerged from the recognition that in society, individuals may initiate force on each other.  Thus, individual rights are *freedoms from the initiation of force* to do something.  The right to life, liberty, property, and happiness means that one ought to pursue those things free from others initiating force.\n\nContrastly, individual rights are not *entitlements*.  This is a critical distinction: Entitlements benefit some people at the expense of others' detriment; freedoms are absent of anyone's detriment.  In order to fulfill an entitlement politically, it's enforced by initiating force: Someone is forced to fulfill another's entitlement because it's the law.  When individual rights are properly understood as freedoms, there is no initiation of force because it's voluntary and anyone can back away if the terms are not worth the trade.</td>

If probed further, their justification is essentially dogma/faith: on the Right, it's because the Bible said so; on the Left, it's because Mommy said so.\n\n---\n\nNow, I know what many of you are thinking: How can you be so insensitive?  I'm all for charities and helping the unfortunate, but (A) it should be voluntary, (B) government-run agencies are less productive than privately-run ones, and (C) it's predicated on self-sacrifice as being the *highest* virtue.  It's even widely corroborated empirically by psychology, whether you're a utilitarian or an egoist: If you want to care for others, care for yourself first.</td>

The robber baron‚Äôs cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be ‚Äòcured‚Äô against one‚Äôs will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals.‚Äù  \n‚ÄîC.S.

If you can‚Äôt justify your existence; if you‚Äôre not pulling your weight in the social boat; if you are not producing as much as you consume or perhaps a little more, then clearly we cannot use the big organization of our society for the purpose of keeping you alive, because your life does not benefit us, and it can‚Äôt be of very much use to yourself.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw</td>

      <td>Cartels require coordination or coercion to enforce, so the primary hope against cartelization is to make it easier for newer miners to be started up, and make it more expensive for miners to cooperate with each other rather than cooperate with users.\n\nAgainst the above, we have the following two centralization pressures:\n\n* Variance discount.  Due to the random nature of mining, a tiny miner might stand to earn lots of money, but at very low probability.  Since miners have a lifetime and will not live forever, waiting for that very low probability to push through would be impractical --- in the long run, everyone is dead.  Thus, many tiny miners might prefer to cooperate with each other and form larger cartels in order to reduce variance in probability of winning the block.\n* Proximity premium.  Due to the non-instantaneous nature of communications in a relativistic universe, discovery of new blocks by other miners means you run the risk of wasting hashpower on a doomed, will-be-orphaned block.  Thus, miners might prefer to cooperate with each other and colocate or merge their businesses, forming larger cartels in order to reduce communications delay when a piece of hardware discovers a fresh block.\n\nAgainst the above, our mitigations are:\n\n* Ensure that mining hardware can be long-lived, by using a well-known stable hashing algorithm instead of changing it all the time, to ensure that we can reach a stable state where all possible optimizations of that hashing algorithm are already well-known and used by most hardware.\n* Ensure fast propagation time relative to the expected average inter-block time, i.e. make sure block propagation is in sub-milliseconds while inter-block times are in several minutes or longer.</td>

It is trivial to extract the hex data from WIF or encode hexdata into WIF.\n\nKey forms that most people are familiar with are as follows:\n\n***\n#### Blockchain.com\n\n```\n79bc617e-8018-4a07-884f-82283013d35e\n```\n\nTechnically this is called a GUID and encodes 16 bytes (128 bits).  I have no idea how that company goes from there to an address.\n\n***\n#### BIP32 private key\n\n^(xprv9s21ZrQH143K3RWN58voUFEwBGZ13SvQC4LL7acVMUN8H1ooHYSss9Cbg5HgHXbgGBDBxdXLkQ3YqCmLQj5RkEFsRMjL3ShEZigGKxet1xc)\n\nThis is a base58 encoding.  If you decode this key back to binary, the important bits are the chain code and key-data.  They are at the following offsets\n\n```\nchain_code = xprv[13:45]\nkey_data   = xprv[46:78]\n```\n\nwhere `xprv[45]` is `0x00` for a private key and either `0x02` or `0x03` for a public key.  You can experiment with this by plugging the `xprv` into the "BIP32 Root Key" section of [Ian's BIP39 utility](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/).\n\n***\n#### BIP39 Mnemonic\n\n```\nsaddle celery child artwork learn dignity silver enable build mouse field fence\n```\n\nThese can be (technically) any multiple of three words from 3 to 24.  Electrum will also use a derivation of this form but the two are not compatible.  The BIP39 form is used to encode the words into a number (`entropy`) which is hashed to create a BIP32 seed.  You can experiment with this by plugging the mnemonic into [Ian's BIP39 utility](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/).\n\n\n***\n#### SLIP39 Mnemonic\n\n^(best pink academic academic easel lying holy rumor injury crystal plastic fancy inform disease step artwork unfair client beyond demand)\n\nThese are generally 20 or 33 words.  The are used with a sharing algorithm to combine into a BIP32 seed.  These are used by the Trezor HW wallets.  You can experiment with this by plugging the mnemonic into "Combine" section of [Ian's SLIP39 utility](https://iancoleman.io/slip39/#combine).\n\n***\n#### WIF format\n\n```\nL16qq7YJMn4yZa5V252CsQ5oQ6QZnG81wxuK4kvu3Bbp7z2gewVk\n```\n\nThis is a base58 encoding.  If you decode this key back to binary, the private key is at `wif[1:34]` which encodes 128 bits of data.  This is used by many wallet exports for a single bitcoin key pair.  Bitcoin Core will also use this format to encode the BIP32 seed `hdseed`.  You can experiment with this by plugging the WIF into [CoinBin's Verify Utility](https://coinb.in/#verify).\n\n***\n#### Raw BIP32 seed data\n\n```\n3ee3ac613e2e54f72d2e5de8b2489485\n```\n\nI've actually never seen a wallet use this form.  It can encode between 128 bits (32 hex chars) and 512 bits (128 hex chars).  This data is hashed to generate the BIP32 `chain_code` and `key_data`.  You can experiment with this by plugging the right number of hex digits in the "BIP39 Seed" field on [Ian's BIP39 utility](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/).</td>

It's easier, more reliable and more secure to hold your own keys.\n\nI understand when people who do not understand bitcoin and see it as a paper asset as everything else must be able to enter this space with their current mindset and it's great there are reliable custodial service for them (that is exchanges operating for very long with good track record) but we have to tell them again and again our mantra not your keys not your bitcoins, so one day they understand that there are better options than custody.\n\nAlso, I dont know of anyone losing their keys when their assets actually had a significant value, the story usually goes "few years ago, when I spent $50 on bitcoin ...", anyone who sees the value in bitcoin back ups their keys reliably.</td>

      <td>It usually means how easy is it to turn to cash, and part of it revolves around price changes to turn to cash. Stocks, bonds, and btc are relatively liquid as I just go to the brokerage and turn it into cash in a couple days for the current price. They're not perfectly liquid like cash, as there can be slippage of value in large quantities, plus a couple days waiting time usually. This is usually in contrast to things like real estate, businesses, equipment, art, etc, where it's not easy to quickly turn it into cash. It could take months or years to turn those into cash, and if you want cash quickly, you  will lose extra value. Those assets are considered illiquid. \n\nAnother factor of liquidity as referenced in the tweet is measured by how much slippage in price there is. If you buy 1B of Amazon stock in 1 day, there will be almost no effect on the price of Amazon as it's highly liquid. If you buy 1B of a small cap stock in 1 day, the price will go substantially up, as there's not enough sellers to absorb the buys at the current price. So Amazon is more liquid than a small cap stock. Btc being able to absorb large buys without much change in price is a sign of high liquidity. Low liquidity stocks like small caps means big players won't really buy them for short term plays because it becomes too small of a percent of their portfolio if they want a small enough position that them getting in and out won't effect the market.</td>

The latter implies much more liquidity in the asset market than the former.\n\nHowever, I would also imagine that the abililty to buy $50m in a single day and not move the price, even if you have to use algorithmic trades to do it, implies that the bitcoin market has a path to liquidity that doesn't involve the price rising first to provide that liquidity.\n\nBitcoin can move from the small number whales to a much larger number of institutional investors via algorithmic trades while the price stays around $10k.  That sets the stage for a price rise because it increases the number of people / institutions that have a stake and are willing to support a higher price floor.\n\nIt also provides for a softer landing of the coming banking crisis.  The more institutions that have a stake in bitcoin, and can transact in it, the less of a threat the banking system will have that no one could transact without them (and therefore we better bail them out or else).</td>

This is how new wealth is generated. \n\nWhat you're talking about is zero sum. That is not how new wealth is created. That process simply transfers wealth from new buyers to old buyers (who also sell). The nominal wealth that goes up when the price goes up is just that: nominal. If that nominal wealth is "real" then that wealth came from the loss of value of the fiat currency used to buy it. However it is still zero sum, not wealth creation.\n\nAgain the wealth creation of bitcoin comes from it's superior qualities as money: as a superior store of value and medium of exchange. Those are basically cost saving things that generate wealth by virtue of being more efficient than the existing alternatives.</td>

That's an extreme example, and would never happen. But it shows how it really matters what the order books look like, and putting money into bitcoin can increase the market cap (and wealth of all holders) by a multiple of the money that was used to buy. You're still right though, that bitcoin's price should increase because of it's superior qualities as money and a store of value.</td>

      <td>&amp;gt; the price can change even without any buying or selling\n\nThe market price cannot in fact change without anyone buying or selling. The market price on a particular exchange is simply the price of the last exchange that happened. \n\n&amp;gt;  If everyone decided that they wouldn't sell for less than 20k anymore, then the market cap would double, and that would be newly created wealth\n\nThe market cap doubling is not newly created wealth. Its what I called "nominal wealth" because its mostly just a number. The wealth is only made manifest when you use or sell those coins. Let's take a couple examples:\n\n1. You buy in at $10k, and it doubles to $20k, then you sell it for fiat. At that point of sale, you have realized gains doubling your initial investment. This is not creating wealth, its transferring wealth from the seller to the buyer. You have made wealth by selling it at a higher price. Its zero sum. \n\n2. Taking a look at the market cap, if the price doubles, it means the market cap doubles. If this isn't just within the noise, it means that value has transferred away from alternatives: ie fiat currencies. If Bitcoin's market cap goes up from $200 billion to $400 billion, it means that the world's fiat currencies and other alternatives collectively went *down* in value by about $200 billion. They compensate exactly. Again, zero sum.\n\nWealth creation happens when someone produces something of more value from something of lesser value. Building a chair transforms cheap wood into a more valuable chair. If you can save costs, you can build the same valuable things at lower cost - that increase the amount of wealth you can build. If you invent new technologies that allow you to do higher-value things for the same cost, you build wealth by increasing the value of things you produce. Wealth cannot be produced without producing something of value. Increasing market cap is not something of value - it simply represents a transfer of wealth from somewhere else.\n\nBitcoin creates wealth by being a better store of value and better medium of exchange than fiat currencies, gold, etc. It is both cheaper and higher value than its alternatives in many areas. It allows people to produce things of higher value for lower cost and therefore builds wealth.</td>

Was new wealth created by the shortage? No, nothing was created. In fact, less was created than before. Wealth was probably lost via whatever created the shortage. However, you still have bananas that are worth a lot more than they were before. Where is your extra money coming from? Well, buyers of the banana that would have been paying less before. Its transferring wealth from them to you. Zero sum.\n\n&amp;gt;  If 10 million in buying pushes the price up really high because of thin order books, and now the market cap has gone up by 10 billion dollars, how does that mean that fiat currencies and alternatives collectively went down by 10 billion?\n\nValue and price are different. The price is always higher or lower than the value. They're basically never equal. If the market cap of bitcoin goes up a ton because of some anomaly like "thin order books", then its price is probably above a sustainable value. But if more people are buying bitcoin, that means higher demand for bitcoin and lower demand for fiat currency. That lower demand is why fiat currencies would be losing market value in that situation.\n\nLook, you can't just pretend that sitting on your bitcoin somehow "creates wealth". New wealth is created through work and innovation, not through sitting on your money. An asset you're sitting on can grow in value, and make *you* wealth, but that wealth is always coming at the expense of someone else.</td>

      <td>I do like this reply. I appreciate it. I need to think about this. Just to get some more input, what if in your example, there isn't a shortage of bananas, but suddenly everyone decides that they enjoy bananas a lot more than they used to? That they value bananas much more highly? Would that not create wealth? And would that wealth come at the expense of something else? \n\nAnd just to be clear, I wasn't talking about an "anomly" in the order books. I was using an extreme case to show that it's true that if people decide that Bitcoin is more valuable than they thought, and pull limit sells off the order books, then the price can rise by much more than the actual money that's used to purchase the Bitcoin. After all, isn't there a buyer for every seller? So... Doesn't that imply that the appreciation in value does come from from something other than the purchasing of the Bitcoin?\n\nMaybe we're saying similar things. I agree that Bitcoin does add value because of the reasons that you've stated. So maybe what I'm saying is that the money that's used to purchase Bitcoin isn't the same as the increase in the market cap. A huge increase in the market cap can come from people realizing that Bitcoin does have intrinsic value. My main initial point was that just because bitcoin's market cap is 200 Billion, that doesn't necessarily mean that 200 Billion dollars have been "put into" Bitcoin. And a 50 million dollar buy doesn't mean that the market cap will increase by 50 million. The reality is that it will likely increase by much more than 50 million. Thanks for the conversation.</td>

      <td>&amp;gt; what if in your example, there isn't a shortage of bananas, but suddenly everyone decides that they enjoy bananas a lot more \n\nWell that's kind of an interesting question. At first I thought it depends very much on *why* everyone's enjoying bananas more, however I changed my mind. If, for example, that extra enjoyment came from people enjoying something else less at the same time, value might be pulled from that. If there's no other consequence and people simply enjoy bananas more without any other change, what it would do is change the priorities of people. So this is actually a similar situation actually. \n\nIf said people generally bought 4 bananas per month, 4 apples per month, and 4 oranges per month, and then suddenly liked bananas a lot more, their appetites probably didn't change, so if they like bananas a lot more now, they're probably just going to do something like buy 8 bananas per month, and reduce the amount of apples and oranges they buy per month. So the wealth would come out of the market value of those other fruit. \n\nNow, going back to what I mentioned about value and price being different, in the above case, the prices would shift around, however the value of the apples and oranges didn't actually change - its just that the value of the bananas went up. So in a sense, whatever caused people to like bananas more did in fact cause more value to be had, creating value and therefore wealth. This would be wealth in terms of economic utility - happiness. A happier people is a wealthier people. \n\nSo if you, for example, produced some kind of genetic technology that made people like bananas more, in effect that would create wealth/utility/happiness. But that is what would be causing it, not the bananas themselves or market price of bananas. The market price would simply be an indicator. \n\nIf it truly happened randomly, the world would be wealthier, but its because of the increased happiness it creates. The market price itself is, to repeat, just an indicator of that. \n\nBringing it back to bitcoin, we agree that the creation of bitcoin created wealth (and its continuing development continues to). I would say that the increasing market cap is simply an indicator that happens as more and more people realize the uses it has and the wealth that it created. However, the market price (just like in the bananas case) increases from the loss of market price of fiat currencies and other things bitcoin is replacing.  \n\n&amp;gt; a 50 million dollar buy doesn't mean that the market cap will increase by 50 million. The reality is that it will likely increase by much more than 50 million.\n\nDefinitely. The market cap is an amplified number in comparison to the actual amount of money that has gone into it.</td>

If you have been watching btc for a while you will see that it goes up, and then pulls back.... It is not a thing of timing the market, it is fact.\n\nYou have to ask yourself...\n\nHow much btc do you want? What is your outlook of holding? How much can you invest weekly/monthly? Are you ok if it drops 40-60%? Do you have money to buy more if it does?\n\nI am like you, I have a core holding, but I also am waiting, saving cash to take advantage of a large dip... I like btc sub 10k..\n\nCurrently when it's up over 10k I just watch my portfolio grow... I'll be happy making a profit, even if I don't add one more satoshi....\n\nBut the time to make money, is buying when the others are fear selling.... And you need available cash to do this... Look at March 2020... The smart ones added to their holdings as it dropped.\n\nEven if btc reaches an ATH..... It will pull back possibly 70-80%.... That means 100k btc is now 20k-30k.... Have money available to take advantage of this.\n\nPatience and hodl is the greatest method.\n\nIf this doesn't resonate, then DCA, and keep raising your bottom line as it goes up....this doesn't make sense to me....just look at people that bought 14k,15k,17k+ they are still not even.\n\nGood luck....

I would even agree that a religion's rate of converting outsiders is proportional to that religion's current number of followers. That is similar to money. Indeed, as Bitcoin amasses more users, the rate of onboarding yet more new users will increase. But the key distinction I'm making is that people adopt a new money because the size of that money's user base makes it more attractive. Would you argue that people adopt a religion because they see how popular the religion is? If following a particular religion is merely about being a member of the largest tribe, then what does that say about the religion's beliefs? Are they secondary?\n\nAlso, the major religions of the world have been around for millennia, and yet we still don't see any one religion trending toward global domination. If a religion's attractiveness is proportional to its size, then if any religion ever has more than half of the world's population following it, then mathematically it would eventually have the entire population.</td>

      <td>&amp;gt; What is the absolute safest way to go about this? \n\nUse a P2P exchange.  Rely on the seller's trust history (i.e., nearly perfect trust history score, many transactions).  Meet in-person, in a public place. Bring a buddy if you are concerned, or if the amount is a larger amount -- especially since you being the buyer paying with cash, you will likely be expected to hand over the cash first.\n\nMultiple smaller trades are better than fewer larger trades -- for safety, if nothing else.</td>
