      <td># Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Sticky FAQ\n\nYou've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  \n\nIt all started with the release of the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following videos for a good starting point for understanding how bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:\n\n* [Video 1: Introduction to Bitcoin - Andreas Antonopoulos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1si5ZWLgy0&amp;amp;list=PLPQwGV1aLnTuN6kdNWlElfr2tzigB9Nnj&amp;amp;index=2&amp;amp;t=1s)\n* [Video 2: The Trust Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKwqNgG-Sv4)\n* [Video 3: Bitcoin 101 - Balaji Srinivasan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIxwTx7o_B4&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=0s)\n\nSome other great resources include [Lopp.net](http://lopp.net/bitcoin.html), the [Princeton crypto series](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7qynvj/dont_panic_just_learn_sixty_free_lectures_from/) and James D'Angelo's [Bitcoin 101 Blackboard series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhe61JaNFLU&amp;amp;list=PLzctEq7iZD-7-DgJM604zsndMapn9ff6q&amp;amp;index=7&amp;amp;t=0s).  \n\nSome excellent writing on Bitcoin's value proposition and future can be found at the [Satoshi Nakamoto Institute](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/).  \n\nSome Bitcoin statistics can be found [here](https://data.bitcoinity.org/bitcoin/hashrate/6m?c=m&amp;amp;g=15&amp;amp;r=week&amp;amp;t=a) and\n [here](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/).  Developer resources can be found [here](https://developer.bitcoin.org/).  Peer-reviewed research papers can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VaWhbAj7hWNdiE73P-W-wrl5a0WNgzjofmZXe0Rh5sg).  \n\nPotential upcoming protocol improvements and scaling resources [here](http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/2018-01-24-rusty-russell-future-bitcoin-tech-directions/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/56nnd8/the_scaling_bitcoin_website_is_awesome_videos/).  \n\nThe number of times Bitcoin was declared dead by the media can be found [here](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)\n\n## Key properties of Bitcoin\n\n* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be 21,000,000 bitcoins created and they are issued in a predictable fashion, you can view the inflation schedule [here](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The halving countdown can be found [here](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/).\n* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read the source code yourself [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin).\n* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).\n* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://stadicus.github.io/RaspiBolt/).  \n* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).\n* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoins reside has the authority to move them.\n* **Low fee scaling** - On chain transaction fees depend on network demand and how much priority you wish to assign to the transaction.  Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view current fees [here](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and mempool activity [here](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w).  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7pwna9/lightning_network_megathread/), a second layer scaling solution currently rolling out on the Bitcoin mainnet.  \n* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).\n* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.\n* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](http://bitcoinsimplified.org/learn-more/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. \n* **Secure** - Encrypted cryptographically and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.\n* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met\n* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible after one or more confirmations.  \n* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries with a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer).\n* **Portable** - Bitcoins are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can even be transported by simply [memorizing a string of words](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) for wallet recovery (while cool this method is generally not recommended due to potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for new users due to ease of use and additional security).\n* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on [Layer 2 networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network) built on top of Bitcoin.\n* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin.\n* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat\n\n## Where can I buy bitcoins?\n\n[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular resources are below, also check out the [bitcoinity exchange resources](https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/exchanges/USD/30d) for a larger list of options for purchases.  \n\n* [Cash app](https://cash.app/help/us/en-us/1016-bitcoin)\n* [Gemini](https://gemini.com/)\n* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)\n* [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/)\n* [BitFinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/)\n* [Xapo](https://xapo.com/)\n* [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/)\n* [Cex](https://cex.io/cards/)\n* [LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/)\n* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)\n* [P2P exchange list](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/) (decentralized) \n\n[Here](http://coinatmradar.com/) is a listing of local ATMs.  If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  \n\n**Note:** Bitcoins are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. [Preev](http://preev.com/btc/usd) is a useful site that  that shows how much various denominations of bitcoin are worth in different currencies. Alternatively you can just Google "1 bitcoin in (your local currency)".\n\n## Securing your bitcoins\n\nWith bitcoin you can **"Be your own bank"** and personally secure your bitcoins **OR** you can use third party companies aka **"Bitcoin banks"** which will hold the bitcoins for you.\n\n* If you prefer to **"Be your own bank"** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn computer security best practices, then a hardware wallet such as the [Trezor](https://www.bitcointrezor.com/), [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/) or [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) is recommended.  Alternatively there are many software wallet options to choose from [here](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) depending on your use case.\n\n* If you prefer to let third party **"Bitcoin banks"** manage your coins, try [Gemini](https://gemini.com/) but be aware you may not be in control of your private keys in which case you would have to ask permission to access your funds and be exposed to third party risk.  \n\n**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** \n\n2FA requires a second confirmation code to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.  \n\nGoogle Auth | Authy | OTP Auth\n--------------|--------|------------\n[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&amp;amp;hl=en) | N/A\n[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384)\n\n## Watch out for scams\n\nAs mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins (shitcoins) are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  Don't trust, verify.  Also as they say in our community "Not your keys, not your coins".  \n\n## Where can I spend bitcoins?\n\nCheck out [spendabit](https://spendabit.co/) or [bitcoin directory](http://bitcoin.directory/shop) for millions of merchant options.  Also you can spend bitcoin anywhere visa is accepted with bitcoin debit cards such as the [CashApp card](https://cash.app/help/us/en-us/3080-cash-card-get-started).

Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](http://folding.stanford.edu/).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read more [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. \n\nIf you want to contribute to the bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions you can [run a full node](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/features/) using [this setup guide](https://blog.lopp.net/how-to-set-up-a-bitcoin-full-node/).  If you would prefer to keep it simple there are [several good options](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/buy-or-diy-an-overview-of-7-bitcoin-full-node-products).

      <td>Key forms that most people are familiar with are as follows:\n\n***\n#### BIP32 private key\n\n^(xprv9s21ZrQH143K3RWN58voUFEwBGZ13SvQC4LL7acVMUN8H1ooHYSss9Cbg5HgHXbgGBDBxdXLkQ3YqCmLQj5RkEFsRMjL3ShEZigGKxet1xc)\n\nThis is a base58 encoding.  If you decode this key back to binary, the important bits are the chain code and key-data.  They are at the following offsets\n\n```\nchain_code = xprv[13:45]\nkey_data   = xprv[46:78]\n```\n\nwhere `xprv[45]` is `0x00` for a private key and either `0x02` or `0x03` for a public key.  You can experiment with this by plugging the `xprv` into the "BIP32 Root Key" section of [Ian's BIP39 utility](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/).\n\n***\n#### BIP39 Mnemonic\n\n```\nsaddle celery child artwork learn dignity silver enable build mouse field fence\n```\n\nThese can be (technically) any multiple of three words from 3 to 24.  Electrum will also use a close relation to this form but the two are not compatible.  The BIP39 form is used to encode the words into a number (`entropy`) which is hashed to create a BIP32 seed.  You can experiment with this by plugging the mnemonic into [Ian's BIP39 utility](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/).\n\n\n***\n#### SLIP39 Mnemonic\n\n^(best pink academic academic easel lying holy rumor injury crystal plastic fancy inform disease step artwork unfair client beyond demand)\n\nThese are generally 20 or 33 words.  The are used with a sharing algorithm to combine into a BIP32 seed.  These are used by the Trezor HW wallets.  You can experiment with this by plugging the mnemonic into the "Combine" section of [Ian's SLIP39 utility](https://iancoleman.io/slip39/#combine).\n\n***\n#### WIF format\n\n```\nL16qq7YJMn4yZa5V252CsQ5oQ6QZnG81wxuK4kvu3Bbp7z2gewVk\n```\n\nThis is a base58 encoding.  If you decode this key back to binary, the private key is at `wif[1:33]` which encodes 128 bits of data.  This is used by many wallet exports for a single bitcoin key pair.  Bitcoin Core will also use this format to encode the BIP32 seed `hdseed` used in the `sethdseed` command.  You can experiment with this by plugging the WIF into [CoinBin's Verify Utility](https://coinb.in/#verify).\n\n***\n#### Raw BIP32 seed data\n\n```\n3ee3ac613e2e54f72d2e5de8b2489485\n```\n\nI've actually never seen a wallet use this form.  It can encode between 128 bits (32 hex chars) and 512 bits (128 hex chars).  This data is hashed to generate the BIP32 `chain_code` and `key_data`.  You can experiment with this by plugging the right number of hex digits in the "BIP39 Seed" field on [Ian's BIP39 utility](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/).\n\n***\n#### Blockchain.com\n\n```\n79bc617e-8018-4a07-884f-82283013d35e\n```\n\nTechnically this is called a GUID and encodes 16 bytes (128 bits).  I have no idea how that company goes from there to an address.</td>

I know it is the reserve currency of the world but printing more USD doesn't automatically mean there will be high numbers of inflation (or perhaps hyperinflation)?\n\nWhat is the difference in regards to the recent tragic events in Turkey, Libanon, Argentine, Venezuela, etc.? Is it all because of money printing that these currencies lost all of their purchasing power? It looks as if other countries will follow? \n\nI find this very interesting but I still can't see the full big picture. Any good sources to keep learning about all this?\n\nDo you guys believe the Euro and Dollar one day will completely dissapear? If they go to a digital Euro/Dollar .. How will that be different from the cash we are using right now?\n\nDo you think the Euro will get the same faith as the USD? I keep reading about money printing in the USA but I hardly read anything about Europe (I live in Europe btw). \n\nI invested a lot of my money into Bitcoin. It's actually the only asset I currently bought as an investment. I am thinking about buying stocks (particularly index funds) since every money book I read recommends this and i also want to diversify a little for if BTC would fail. Now I'm wondering in which index fund I should invest .. I particularly wonder if America will remain the most powerful capitalist country or if China will take over in the next 50 years .. That's the only thing preventing me from investing in stocks. I don't know what to invest in and especially since now all stocks are so high priced .. \n\nI know this is kind of a ramble but I would love to gain new perspectives from everybody.

The money from this fundraising period would support the company’s ambitious plans to create a market-leading bitcoin exchange in the U.S. \n\nBack in April, Bitnomial was one of the select few U.S. businesses to gain approval from CFTC to manage a designated contracts market (DCM). Such approval allowed Bitmonial to offer bitcoin futures and options, as The Block previously reported.</td>

Is it possible to say in which country Bitcoin is stored (given the dezentralized register)?

      <td>I got hit with ransomware back in 2015. Used Coin Café to buy $500 (yes I paid - wearing a paper bag over my head) in bitcoin. Of course, I bought a few dollars over because bitcoin value fluctuated somewhat. After the pain of this, I didn't want to have anything to do with it anymore and abandoned the account.\n\nWell, a few months ago, I started getting emails from Coin Café saying that I had to log in at least once a year to keep the account open. I ignored the first couple, then said what the heck - I knew the email address because of which of my email addresses it was sent to. Did Forgot Password bit and got into my account. Those couple of dollars over were now about $1400!\n\nI had to go through an extensive account validation process before I could do any more that just look at the account - email front and back of my driver's license, email photo of me holding the license, email recent bank statement and utility bill, etc. Finally, I was able to sell the bitcoin and transfer the balance to my bank account:)\n\nCoin Café really went the second mile holding my account for so long and pestering me to log in to keep it open. These are really honest people - a less scrupulous outfit could have just done nothing and kept the money. Big endorsement of them.\n\nThe small warning is this - they required extensive documentation to validate the account, as they should have. However, that means that they have all this extensive documentation which, in the wrong hands, could let a hacker open accounts in my name or even take over an existing account. I believe that they have top flight security, but so did {insert company of your choice} when they got hacked. So always be mindful of security - freezing credit bureaus, two factor authentication, complex passwords, etc., and always monitor your accounts.\n\nOnce again, thanks Coin Café.</td>

      <td>At this point we are out of ideas, so I decided to come to the smartest bunch of people the world has to offer... Redditors. \n\nThe problem is that I recently just became aware and realized that one of the Minecraft servers that I was obsessed with back in about 6th grade (around 2010 I believe) used Bitcoin as a way to make purchases on the server. This was my favorite server, so for my birthday, my mom gave me $200 dollars to spend however I wanted, and I spent it all on bitcoin so I could get armor, costumes, and stuff like that in the game. A few weeks went by, and just like every other 6th grader on the planet, my interests and hobbies would change quite rapidly, and I stopped playing Minecraft. I believe that I spent about $50 worth of bitcoin and the rest is sitting in a virtual wallet waiting for me to access it. \n\nNow me and my brother have researched everything we could about this in the last few weeks, but as of now, we are not pros and simply know the basics of what we can possibly do. I know I need a 6 digit code to access my wallet, and I specifically remember having the number written on a paper stuck in my room, but I have no clue what that number is and have moved several times since then so there is zero chance of finding that paper. \n\nThere is a lot of money on the line and if any of you guys have information that could help me get access to my digital wallet I will probably tattoo your reddit name on my body I’d be so happy.\n\nAny help you guys could give me I would love but I understand that things like this are highly complex. I appreciate any suggestions or anyone that takes time to help me out.</td>

The timestamp of creation for each UTXO is available. You can get the price at that timestamp and compare to the current price...above (loss) or below (profit).\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nThe total supply metric is hanging me up in two areas...I don't know exactly what the mean by "move". Does that mean when the UTXO was transacted and subsequently destroyed, a UTXO can only be spent once to prevent double spend right? When you "move" a BTC you really create a new UTXO for the receiver and a second UTXO if the sender is due change. I don't understand describing that as "move".\n\nAnd "supply" in this context of comparing to UTXO is unclear to me. I get that total supply is \~18.5m BTC mined and circulating. But how are you tracking whether a BTC is in profit or not when BTC are often carved up by the UTXO processing? If I mined a BTC and spent multiple portions of it over 10 transactions...that BTC doesn't really exist anymore...because it's UTXO doesn't exist.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope that is clear.

      <td>I have a large amount of  cash saved up and I am looking into dumping a good amount of it into BTC, I have been researching different ways to do so and they all seem very sketchy at first glance.  Has anyone here done this before? I'd like to avoid any bank transactions while being safe about the whole thing.  I am not very savvy when it comes to the technical side of BTC and obviously extremely concerned about getting ripped off.  What is the absolute safest way to go about this? Also any IRS implications?   \n\n\nThanks!!!</td>
